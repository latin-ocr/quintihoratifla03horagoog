182 NOTES ΟΝ THE SATIRES: BOOK ΙΙ. SAT. v-

3941. Seu mbm......conspuet Alpes. These lines, with their misapplied ingenuit-v
os metaphor and epithet‚ are thought to bo wholly parodied from Furius’
poeuis, (See Sat. 1. x. 36.) Rubra is perhaps a forced synonym for flagri-aus,
or fervens. Infantes is strained from the prov. (Ep. 11. ιι. 83) ‘ Statua tacitur-
nius? Consptoet Alpes is allowed to be the phrase on which the nickname Alpinus
is founded. Pinqui omaso is a coarse phrase, uniit for epic poetry‚ and
either ridiculed on that ground, or else an actual description of the poct’s
figure and voracity.

44. Avi-nabunt thamni. Cp. Aristoph. qu. 313,-⁴r0b5 φόρους θυννοσκοπῶν, (said of
Cleon, ou the look-out for foreign tributes.)

45. Validus vitale, “ an invalid.”

46. ΒΊξώἶαίιω. lViry. AEn. 11. 203‚—‘Sublatum erudiit! So susceptu-3, as in Cic.

49. Effer-it Orco. Comp. Car. Ι. xxvln. 10‚-‘ Orco demissum! So Virq. AEn. Π.
398; 11. 527, 785. These constructions are clearly based on Homer, I l. α. 3,
ψυχὰς Ἀῒδιπροΐαψεν; it is not so clear whether they are poetical datis-es of
place (signisying motion towards) or datives of object, which is a more usual
syntax. In Homer, Ἀἳδι is probably a person, the King os Hades. Comp. Il.
ο. 190, aud see Heyne and Bothe’s Annotations on 1l. α. 3. In AEn. 11. 81,
mitteret umbris is used of persons, sc. the Di Inferi.

55. Recoctus scriba av quinqueviro, i. e. a practised man of business, not easily
imposed upon. Recoquere. ‘ Saepiusz‘ iu alios formare usus’ (see on (ἴαν-τη.
ΙΙ. 1. 382,-‘ Est igitur...mutata condicione factus quaesticuli causa scriba ex
⁴ quinquevim.’-—Orelli.

The sc-riboe (sce Dect. os Antqu. art. ‘ Scriba ²) were notai-ies or secretarios,
public servants, whose office was to rogistcr the public deeds of the senate, or
the magistrates (e. 9. praetors, aediles,) to whom they were attached. Cicero,
in Ver-r. 111. 79, calls them ‘ ordo honestus ...... quod eorum hominum fidei
tabulae publicas periculaque magistratuum (“judicial records '’) committuntur!
Horace held sor a timo a scriptus quaestorius. quinqueviri were commissionem
of various kinds.

58. Puris. Cp. the Gr μάντις, from μαίνομαι.

59. This line makes good sense, though at first sight it seems a mero reductio nd

absunlum. “ What will huppen, will happen, is Ι tell you it will,” and vice
versa. (Phil. Mus. p. 461.)

65. Soldum, i. e. solidum, ‘⁸ his dcbt ;'’ lit. “ his whole debt.’'

general sense, as in Liv. xxxix. 51‚-‘ Ut nomo indo elabi posset!

ib. si posset, “ to see if she could, so that she might is possible ;” an idiom eom-
mon in Greek: e. 9. Thur. 1. 583 Hom. Il. β. ‘72; v. 4643· and Odyss. 1. 94,-
ἤν που ἀκούσῃ, followed by the answeriug clause, ἧδ’ ἵνα ...... Comp. Vir-9. Ain.
