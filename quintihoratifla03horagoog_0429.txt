SATIRE ΙΙΙ.

Τ110 subject here seems to be the rule vitiis nemo sine (as in υ. 68.), and the
deductione from it; e. 9. that the observation of faults in others should remind
ns of our own3 that the best construction should be put upon each other’s
actions; and that censures, where there is call for them, should be modified
and discriminating.

The method pursned is a notice of the levities and inconsistencies of
Tigellius—a confession of the satirist's own defects,—-for which he claims a
fair and kind consideration, and then argues against the unfriendly and
censorious habit prevalent in society, and finally against the arbitr-ary Stoio
rule, which classed all offences as equal,-——a rule in its practical application
nnnatural and inequitable.

3. Sardus...2·lze Tiqelzius. 'Phe Scholiast quotes a satiric verse (a scazon Iambic)
upon him, -—‘ Sardi Tigelli putidum caput venit. ' See Cic. ad Fam.x'11.24.
(The proverb Sardi venales dates from 13.c. 176, when Sardinia was subdued
by Τ. S. Gracchus.) He 1s spoken ofin the last sat. v. 3, as recently dead.
Observe the imperf. habebat' 1n this sense.

ib. I 110 quasi de notoss Schol.
4. Qui-...posset‚ “ who might have,” not “ who might.”
5. Patris, i. e. ‘⁴ his adopted satha-,¹² Julius caesar.

6. collibuisset, cosmpound of zebet, used by cic. N. D. 1. 38 ; ad Fam. xv.16; with
a nom. case, by Sallust, Cat. 51.

ib. Ab ovo...ad mala, “from the beginning to the end of dinner. “Integram
famem ad ovum affer0,' Cic. ad Fam. 11. 20. Mala and bellaria. (“fruits and
confectionery”) were brought in at dessert. (See Becker's Gallus, Eme. 1)

¹7. citaret, “run over rapidly or repeatedlyss' Lachmann explains it by com·
pellar-e, as in Cic. Pin. 11. 183 or celeri &7oe73‘1'peraqera Cp. 010.ἀο Orat. 1.
mx. 251, — ‘Paeanem aut Nomionem citarimus?

ib. Io Bacche. The beginning or burdcn of a song. Ἰόβακχοι is a Greek com·
pound for “drinking songs.” Cp. Βακχέβακχον ᾆσαι, Arist. Equit. We may
compare too Io l’oeanin 0v.A.A.11.1‚and Io Triumphe, Ο. lv. 11. 50. But
there ιε great doubt whether this reading 1s genuine. Lachmann (on Luc r. 11.
27) utterly condemns it, on the score of prosody: ho decides for Io Ba. chaeoe
Cp. Eur. Bae-c h. 572—AE βάκχαι, ιὼ βάκχαι. No doubt tho chief MSS. have
Bacche, but their testimony is not decisiv03 it is so common with them to
put e for (ιε rather, as some good copies certainly write Bac-chre, their
authority seems greater thau tho negative testimony of 1110 majority.
