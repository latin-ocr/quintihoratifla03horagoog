18. Persii-imis, ‘⁸ strike upon, deafen ;” iu a kindred signification 3‘ to dazzle,” as
Quin-til. X. 1. 30,--‘ Fulgor quo mens simul visusque perstringitur!

[0.] says,—‘ Perstrinqero de auribus acuto vel terribili sono percussis ’ (i. e.

“ to deafen ;”) ‘ prastrinqere de oculis subito splendore vel fulmine prope

caecatis ’ (Le. ‘⁸ to dazzle.”) The distinction is, no doubt, true ς per denoting

what penetrates to the remoter or inward sense, the hearing or the mental

facult53 proe, action upon what is forward 01: in frent, as the eyesight. Yet

the words have been constantly confounded, as may be seen in in Gesnor’s mee

38. Ceoe ...... nenia. Simonides of Ceos, the great lyrio poet, one of the literary ¹

CARM. 11.-AD SALLUSTIUM CRISPUM.

The sentiment of this Ode corresponds ιο, and is, perhaps, taken from Theocr. xvr.
22, sq. It is a question whether it contains more of irony, or counsel, or
praise. The subject of it (C. Sallustius, great nephew of the historiau) is
once mentioned elsewhere (Sat. Ι. 11. 48, sqq.) as an extravagant profligate.
Iu the period intervening between that poem and this (about sixteen years,)
he may have grown νήθει-ς perhaps ‘modeste munificus? as he is there de-
scribed. We leat-n from Tacitus (Ann. ιιι. 3Ο,) that he was fond of, or at least
affected, luxury and eleganee (the means sor which he had in the wealth left
him by his great uncle, who had died s.c. 34 ;) but that he was really a man
of energy as well as influence. During the life-time of Maecenas, he ranked
next ιο him ; aster his death, he succeeded him in his place in the oounsels of
Augustus. He died A. n. 20.

2. Abdita terris. He had valuable copper mines among the Ceutrones (‘ iu Cen-
tronum alpino tractu: Plin. H. N. xxxw. 2) to which some have thought

allusion is hore made.
