mention. The positive evidence is, that in Sat. 11. VI. 40 (the date of which is
restrained, by the circumstances mentioned in υυ. 38, 53, and 56, to the year
30 or the end of 31, nc.) ¹it is affirmed that his familiarity with Maeoenas
(sim-um in numero) had commenced less than eight years before, i. e. in 38
Β. c. οι· 39, at the earliest.

Kirchner (Quaest. Horat.) gives a full review of the circumstances, and
argues strongly for connecting tho Iter with the treaty of Tarentum. The
difficulty is why Brundisium should be mentioned as the end of the journey‚
rather than Tarentum. The solution of the difficulty is no doubt conjecturalg
but it is to be borne in mind that the Satine is not an explanatory one, nor
does it touch on public affairs. Thus, while possibly Brundisium (off which
Antony's fleet had arrived) was the intended terminus, Horace, not being a
political friend but merely an amusing compauion, may well have been left
behind when the place of meeting was altered, while his patron went forward
to meet Octavian. If he went on to Tarentum (as Wnlckenoeer, with a refer-
enee to Curm. 11. 6, supposes him to have done,) political reserve might be a
sufficient reason sor his silence on the subject. The opportunity for humorous
description must have ended with the arrival at Brundisium.

For the topographical details, ll'ctlckenaer, livr. IV. c. ¹7, may be consulted,

‚ and Gibbon's lissey, where he examines this journey‚ and that of Cicero into
Cilicia, as illustrative exemplos of Roman travelling. 1 have set down the
distances according to Orelli's computation, with Gibbon's variatione. The
time occupied is not distinctly expressed in the Satire: Orelli makes it out as
sevcntcen days, Gibbon as twelve, Walckenaer as fourteen. The distance is
reckoued by the first as 314- miles, two days being omitted ; by Gibbou as
369 3 by Walckenaer as 378 Roman miles.

1. Aricia. Connected with the legend of Hippolytus, Ov. Fust. 111. 2633 Vir-9.
AEn. vxr. 761. Now Riccia, sixteen miles from Rome.

3. Pomm Appi. Now Boo-90 Lzmqo, twenty-seven miles from Aricia.

4. Maliqnis, to be taken with cauponibus, not separately. Cp. Sat. 1. 1. 29. For
atque, in the second place of the sentence, see Sat. I. v, 27; Π. 1315 vn. 12.

5. Iter ...... divisimus, i.e. “we took two days for our journey to Forum Appii,
‘⁴ more active travellers take but one.'’

ib. Altius...praecin0tis. Gr. εὔζωνος.
6. Appia. See an account of this great road in Arnold’s mst. ch. xxxu. p. 287.

8. Indico bellum. Cp. the use of this phrase, Cic. de Smwct. 14,--‘ Bellum in-
‘ dixisse voluptati?

11. The travellers had now arrived at the Fossa Auousbi, a canal, called also
&geggziinggmwigpm its length of nineteeu Roman miles, running parallel with

12. H uc- appelle, “ come alongsirle here.” Gr. παραβαλοῦ, οι· τὴν ἄκατον παραβάλλου,
as in Ar. Rau. 180; Equ. 762.

ib. Trecentos. Ser-ceriti is the most common term for an indefinite number5 here
it is halved: in Sat. II. 111. 61 it is doubled. Compare Germ. 111. lv. 793
Pla-ut. Aulul. ΙΙΙ. v. 44.

16. Viator. ‘ Nau-ta in navi, viator qui mulam ducebat.’ schol. But this does not
accord with v. 19, from which it seems clear that nauta is the “conductor‚‘’
aud therefore that viator must be some country passenger.

y& Feronia luco.' γίνῃ. AEn. vn. 799.
