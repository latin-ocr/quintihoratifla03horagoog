NOTES ΟΝ THE EPODES: GARM. ινιτ. 127

7. Ros-bimam, “ the magio wheel,'’ the ἴυγξ of Theocr. 11. 17 3 also described there,
in v. 30, as ῥόμβος χάλκεος.

8. Telephus, son of Hercules. See Ov. Rem. Am. 46,—
‘ Vulnus in Herculeo quae quondam fecerat hoste,
‘ Vulneris auxilium Pelias hasta tulit?

11. Unxere, ἐκ. they recovered his corpse. The ἀλείφειν λίπ’ ἐλαίῳ, (Hom. Il. σ.
ἱοῖζγνδαὸεθοῃο of the principal funeral ceremonias, Cp. Virq. AEn. vl. 2193 Ov.

ib. Addictum, “ given over; abandoned (in intention) t0.”
12. Homicidam. ἀνδροφόνοιο, Hom. I l. α. 242.

15. Emere pellibus. See Hom. Odyss. κ. 393,-
τῶν δ’ ἐκ μὲν μελέων τρίχες ἕῤῥεον, κ.τ.λ.

ὣ. Pellibus. Pellis is the hide of animals, not the human skin, though satirically
used for it in v. 223 as in J uvenal’s description of old age (x. 192),—‘ deformem
pro cute pellem.’

22. Ossa. Bentley reads ora, which would suit well with verecundus color, bnt not
with pelle amicta. The sense is identical with that of Plautus, (ἔαρι. Ι. 11. 25,—
‘ Macesco‚ consenesco, et tabesco miser,
‘ Ossa atque pellis sum miser macritudine.’

And so Theocr. 11. 88,—
καί μευ χρὼς μὲν ὅμοιος ἐ) ivero πόλλακι θάψω,

ἔῤῥευν δ’ ἐκ κεφαλᾶς πᾶσαι τρίχες, αὐτὰ δὲ λοιπὰ ’
ὀστέ’ ἔτ’ ἧς καὶ δέρμα.

27. Neqatum ..cv-edam, “ Ι am forced to believe what I have always denied.'’ The
syntax accords with the mle, that credo and the like verbs have a dative of
the person, an accusative of the thing, (e. 9. in Ter. Ad. Act 111. Sc. 11. 330,—
‘ Quid jam credas, aut cui credas ?’ ). But it will be hard to find an instance
parallel to this one. (The case of pronouns is different.)

28. sabella. ‘Sabella carmina pro Marsis posuit ι’ schot.

ib. Incregcse, ‘⁸ to sound or strike against :” here, “ to touch (and overpower) the
min .

29. Marsa...nenia. Ov. A. A. 11. 102,—‘ Mixtaque cum magicis nenia Marsa sonis?
ib. Dissilire, i. e. “ be raekcd to bursting.’'

30. Ter. Ad. 790,— ‘ O coelum, O terra, O mar-ia Neptuni !' The reading et terra is
that of all the good MSS. Orelli's objection ‘ misere languet ' does not, Ι
think, apply to the double phrase, as it would to the Terentian line.

31. Quantum...Hercules. Cp. δορὴ. Trach. 840,—
Νέσσυυ θ’ ὕπο φόνια
compano« κέντρ’ ἐπιζέσαντα.

Cp. too the descriptive speech, υυ. 1046—1106.

33. Virens. Explained ογ some as inextincta, and compared with Lacr-et. 1. 899,
‘flammai flore ,·' but ογ Orelli as expressing the colour of the sulphureus flame
of the volcano‚-—‘ colore inter gilvum viridem et caeruleum medio! Some
MSS. have urens, and a few sarens, which is adopted and illustrated by

Bentle .
36. Quod...sytipendium, “ what further fine or penalty will yon impose P''

40. Here the poet proposes to doify the sorceress (stellis inserere, Ο. ΙΙΙ. xxv, 6.)
Then he appeals to her by the example of the Dioscuri: then, by ironical
recantations, he charges her with low birth (v. 46), witchcraft (47), foul
cruelty (49), and supposititious births.

ib. Voles sonari. Cp. (without the sai-casm) Ov. Am. Ι. x. 60,—
...‘ Celebrare puellas
‘ Dos mea; quam volui nota fit arte mea!
