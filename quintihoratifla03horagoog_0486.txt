192 NOTES ΟΝ THE SATIRES .· BOOK 11. SAT. vur.

He uses maris expers ae =“ wanting in vigour, unmanly, weak.'’ He is
speaking of newly adopted notione imported by ‘ Doctores Graios...sapere...
nostrum hoc maris expers! “ This new and emasculate philosophy os ours.”
Maris with him is clearly the genitive of ms, not mare. And so, in Horace,
the Chian wine ie “ wanting in body,” having lost all strength aud flavour by
age,—oostly, but worthless.

20. Summus eqo‘, etc. 'rho account of this arrangement is fully given in the Dict.
of Antiqq. art. ‘ Tricliniumss

ib. Viscus Thurinus, i. e. ‘⁴ of Thurii. This epithet distinguishes him from the
two brothers, Horace’s friends, mentioned Sat. Ι. x, 83. [O.]

21. Serv-itio. This must be scanned as a ffisyllable3 as AlfeniuS, Sat. Ι. 111. 130.
ib. Balatrone. This may have been a nick-name. Cp. balatrones, in sat. I. 11. 2.
22. Umbra-⁹, “ uninvited guests.’' 23. Ipsum, i. e. “the host.”

24. Obsorbere. This is a stronger compound than absorbere or exsorbere (which
here, and in S. 11. 111. 240, are various readings for ἰὴ) and significa “ eagerly
“ swallowing, gulping down.'’ Cp. obduco, as in Cic. Tusc. Qu. Ι. 11.. 96‚—‘ Cum
‘ venenum ut sitiens obduxisset?

ib. Bead semel=uno haustu. See Bentley’s note.
25. Λᾶ hoc qui=pr0pter hoc ut.

26. Nam cetera, “ sor we all, excepting him, found the dishee, various aa they
“were‚ disguised completely by their flavour-ing.” (Compare Peven'l- os the
Peak, ch. xxvn,—‘ Never saw so unnurtured a cub; knew no more what he
‘ eat than an infidel !’) The principalrword is not cenamus, but celantia, as in
Sat. Ι. w. 79 3 and so v. 19.

29. Passeris, “ flounder.” Bentley reads passm-123 assi et. [0.] calls the reading
‘ petulans nesciocujus interpolatio ducta ex Sat. II. lv, 38.’

30. Inqustata mihi, “ which 1 never tasted before.”
31. Melinwla, “ honey apple⁸.” ‘ Dicuntur a sapore melleo‚’ Ptin. xv· 14.
34. Mor-imur inulti. ι Compare γίνῃ. AEn. 11. 670.

35. Calices...majores. Was Vibidius privileged, by the invitation of Μωοεῐιαε, to
do this in despite of the master of the house? or was it to make fun os him Ρ
Comp. Sat. Ι. IV. 87. It was the custom after the cena (properly so called) to
call sor majora pocula (comp. Cic. Verr. 11. 1. 26.) So Γύῃ. AEn. 1. 723,—

‘ Postquam prima quies epulis mensaeque remotae
‘ Crateras magnos statuunt!

Comp. Eur. Ion, 1178,-ἆφιιρπά<“ειν χρεὼν
οἰνηρὰ τεύχη σμικρὰ μέγαλα δ’ εἰσφέρειν.

39. Allifanis, from Allisae in Samnium, ‘ ubi fictiles et latiores calices fiebant? Schol.

46. Garum, a pickle made from the fieb qums originally, also from the soom-ber (or
mackerel.) The scombri were caught in greatest abundance off the shore of
Carthaqo Nova, or Spartaria, and the island opposite; hence called Scombraria.
See Pliny, N. H. xxxl. 43. And compare Μανΐίαὶ, ΧΙΙΙ. 011:

Garum sociorum.
‘ Exspirantis adhuc scombri de sanguine primo
‘ Accipe fastosum, munera cara, garum!
The Greek is γάροςΓ--καὶ τὸν ἰχθύων γάρον. AEsch. Fr. 195.

50. Quod Methymnaeam... i. e. Lesbian vinegar.

52. Incoquere, “to dress in (or, with) this sauce.” Cp. Viry. (ἔω. 1V. 2793 and
ἦξεὲθδῐέὸβιί, for a metaphorical application‚—‘ Incoctum generoso pectus

53. Melius muria qumod, i. e. “ as the tante which the abeli-fieb naturally gives ους,

is better than prepared pickle.'' (Quam is the reading os some MSS. and is
interpreted “ as better than the piekle prepared from shell-fish.”)
