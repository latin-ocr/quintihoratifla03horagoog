44 NOTES ΟΝ THE ODES: BOOK 11. 111, ιτ.

28. Cmnboe. Eur. Alc. 252,—

ὁρῦ δίκαιον dp& σκάφος, νεκύων δὲ πορθμεύς
ἔχων χέρ’ ἐπὶ adn* Χάριν μ’ ἤδη καλεῖ.
AEsch. S. C. Theb. 858,—·nb ἅστονον μελάγκροκον ναύστολον θεωρίδα. Wagner

gives suu evidence sor this form, cumboe, though he notes it as an exception to
the rule that, in words of Greek origin, y represents ν.

CARM. IV.—AD XANTHIAM PHOCEUM.

Xanthias Phoceus=X. the Phocian3 an ideal Greek name. See the
Philoloqicczl Mus. Vol. Ι. p. 452, sqq„ where Buttmann contrasts the historica!
character of the fragments of Sappho with the artificia] style of these Odes.
⁸ In Horace, the materials and persons are themselves the product of art ε he
‘ had te create them, just as much as his imagery and his words!

1. Ancilloe, transl. ‘⁸ a captive ’⁹ (⁸ fingit amicum veluti heroicis temporibus amare
captivam! Ο.) Cp. Hom. Il. ι. 842,—
ὦς καὶ ἐγὼ τὴν (sc. Briseida)
ἐκ θυμοῦ φίλεον δουρικτητήν περ δοῦσαν.

Ου. Am. ΙΙ. ΠΗ. 11,—· Thessalus aucium faciffiBriseidos arsit)

2. Insolentem. Cp. A. P. 122 [O.] But is not the word used in its proper sense
here, “net wont to be moved ?’' ‘Insolmati laetitiass supra, ΙΙΙ. 111, is “un-
wonted,'' is. “ extravagant ;” in carm. 111. 1111. 50, ‘⁸ delighting in change ;'’
in Ep. xm. 75, insolentiae is paraphrased in Orelli's note ‘ insolitis artibus!

10. Ademptus Hector, “ the death os Hector, (the fact of Hector’s having been
slain .”
Cp. ZCethegus deprehensus '=“ the arrest of Cethegus,” Sallust, Cat. 48.ο
Carm. IV. vlu. 16. viv-9. AEn. 111. 280,—‘ post eruta Pelgama.' Ov. 1⁵⁹. 1. 453,—
‘ defensa Capitolia? See more instanees in Madm’q, Gr. 426, and especially one
in Thucyd. 111. 36, where the usage accounts for the connection of a singular
verb with a plural noun. 1 cannot think Dr. Donaldson right in restoring the
plural προσεπεβάλοντο. In Livy, ιι. 5, the editors place a stop after ‘ lictores
abire jussi paludamentaque detracta ς’ but the verb, ‘ miserationem fecit‚’ must
be referred to that clause for its nom. case.

11. Cp. Hom. Il. ω. 243 3 Viry. AEn. 11. 155.

ib. Leviom. Hom. Ι l. χ. 287 (Hector ad Aelim),-

καί κεν ἐλαφρότερος πόλεμος ‘spirtum γένοιτο
σεῖο καταφθιμένοιο.

17. Scelesta. This adjective may be understood in a general sense, or taken to be
an imitation of Theognis and the early Greek Poets, with whom κακὸς stands
for ‘⁶ base-born ;’' ἐσθλός, οι· ἀμύμων, for “ high-born.” Compare tho usage of
δυσγένεια, (=“ baseness.”) Eur. Herc. F. 663.

24. Clauders, πλε. “ to close.” ‘ claudere dicit non condere lma-um censoria formula
consulto abstinens.’ [O.] The one phrase may remind us of the other, but
could not, perhaps, be substituted for it. Condere lustrum (as we may inser
from Livy, 1. 44) meant seemingly “ tf) offer a lustrationuby way of eompleting3

ib. Ine-strum, a period of five years. “ Suspect not me, who am just sorty years
old.'· Ov. Trist. IV. x. 78, ‘Novemque Addiderat lustris altera lustra
