188. Plebeius. Hom. Il. μ. 212,-

ἐπεὶ οὐδὲ μὲν οὐδὲ ἔοικεν
δῆμον ἐόντα παρὲξ ἇγορεύεμεν.

191. Hom. Il. α. 18,—

ὒμῖν μὶν θεοὶ δοῖεν Ὀλύμπια δώματ’ ἔχοντες
ἐκπέρσαι Πριάμοιο πόλιν εὖ δ’ οἴκαδ’ ἱκέσθαι.

ib. Deducere is the better reading, and rightly explained by Orelli as
‘domum ducere, ut decedere de provincia'=‘ in urbem redire! It is the
regular word, (e.9. Liv. xxm. 28) for “ withdrawing troops hommem-d, or
conducting them to their destination.” Bentley undet-stands it (not so well)
in its common sense of “ launohing ships.'’ Reducem has a majority of MSS.
in its favour, and the first syllable is lengthened in Lucretius. But it may be
safely conjectured to be the correction of a copyist, who did not recognise the
proper and consistent use of deducere.

194. putescit. Cp. ‘putescat corpore posto,' Lucr. ιιι. 871. Hom. Od. α. 161.—
λεύκ’ ὀστέα πύθεται ὄμβρῳ. Hom. Il. λ. 394‚—-8 δέ θ’ αἵματι γαῖαν ἐρεύθων

πύθεται.

195. Hom. Il. α. 255,—'n κεν γηθήσαι Πρίαμος, Πριάμοιό τε παῖδες.

197. Milia ovium. Mille, in the plural, is always a substantive3 in the singular,
rare .

Aul. 883,---Ἀρί·έι.ιιδιὴ θύσειν παῖδα σὴν μέλλει πάτηρ. And 893,-φρονῶν γὰρ
ἔτυχε σὸς πόσις τότ’ εὖ (i. e. “ when he relented, and changed his purpose.’')

205. Adverso, i. e. “ the opposite shore.'' The scene of the dialogue must be sup-
posed to be (cp. υ. 191) at Troy.

206. Pmdens, “knowingly‚ with design;” as in Epist. 11. 11. 18; Ars Ρ. 462.
Properly therefore, or in common lang-uage, the opposite of insanus. cicero
(de Off. 111. 25) quotes Agamemnon’s action as the wrong keeping of a rash
promise.

208. Alias veris. Veri is the reading of many copies, which Gesner explains as
‘ Hellenismus pro alias vero! Others take alias by itself, for diversas. The
present reading seems preferable, and admits of being thus rendered,—“ He
“ who adopts sancies other than the true (i. e. at variance with true principle),
“ and confoundcd by the force of evil passione, must be held to be disordercd
“ in mind.'’

209. Οοιηιηοῦιιεείηεαηιιε, or furiosus, as v. 278.
