1:38 NOTES ΟΝ THE EPODES: CARM. xvu.

42. Infantis Helenoe...vicem, “on account of the defamation of Helen.” Vice is the
general MS. reading. Orelli (after Bentley) adopts vicem, and confirms it, as
the Latin usage, by a series of quotations. Bentley quotes ΙΛέυ. vul. 35,—
‘ Tribunos suam jam vicem mag-is anxios) cp. ‘ An illius vicem doles ?’ (in
Sulpicius’ letter,) Cic. Fam. ni. 5.

44. Vati, i. e. Stesichorus. (The story is given in Plato, Phaedrus, XLIV. p. 243, with
a quotation from the παλινῳδία.) He was said to have satirised Helen; to
have been struck blind by the Dioscuri5 then, upon his recantation, to have
been healed by them. In recanting, heis said to have invented or adopted
the tale, that Helen was never carried to Troy, but only her εἴδωλον, according
to the Egyptian legend of Herod. 11. 118, and the Helena of Euripides. ,

Cp. Ov. A. A. 111. 49,-—‘ Probra Therapnaeae qui dixerat ante maritae,
‘ Mox cecinit laudes prosperiore lyra.’

47. 80 ovid (Ep. vl. 89) describes Medea’s sorceries,-—

‘ Per tumulos errat .........
‘ Certaque de trepidis colligit ossa rogis.’

48. Novencliczlis‚ i. e. “recently buried.’' Servius, on Vim. AEn. v, 64, notes that
anciently a dead man ‘ ad domum snam referebatur, et illic septem erat diebus,
⁶ octavo incendebatur, nono sepeliebatur.' The number of nine days was held
sacred with regar-d to the rites of sepulture. 80 in Vir-qil, l. c. ‚- and AEn. V.
7 62. So in ovid, Fast. v. 413,—

‘ Nona dies aderat, cum tu, justissime Chiron,
‘ Bis septem stellis corpora cinctus eras.’ ,

Cp. vv. 439, 443, nomes. So probably in γίνῃ. Geor. IV. 544. Cicero men·
tiens (ad Qu. Fr. 111. 5) ‘ Novendialibus feriis! The same number is found in
other solemn ceremonies, as the expiator-y ‘ Ν ovendiale sacrum ’ in Liv. 1. 31.
80 with the Greeks, τὰ lurum and, perhaps, the nine days of the Eleusinian
mysteries has a connection with the same idea.

50. Tumque venter, ἇς. “And Pactumeius is really your son3 and the midwife
:1 gastau-e, not deceptive proofs of the birth, whenever you have become a

56. Ut, “What?'Are you to deride with impunity‚” ea? This eniptical use of
ut occurs again, Sat. 11. v. 18. So in Liv. lv. 2,—‘ Illine ut impune ......... con-

‘ citent!

ib. Cotyttia, a Thracian festival, notorious for its licentiousness, in honour of a
goddess Cotys or Cotytto.

58. “The priest or president of the witeb rites on the Esquiline.'’ An invidious
term, substituted for “ a witness of them,'’ as he implies himself to have been
in Sat. I. vul. and for which he is reproached again, ν. 77, by the epithet
curiosus.

60. “ What use would it be to me, to have seed the witches os the North (comp.
v. 29‚) and to have learnt their arts ?'’

62. Cp. Eur. Hipp. 10 l7,·—-·raxiss γὰρ ᾅδης ῥᾷστος ἀνδρὶ δυστυχεῖ, Comp. Southey's
Kehamu, Ο, 2‚—‘ And thou shalt seek Death

‘ To relieve thee in vain,' &c-

65. Infidi. This is explained of Pelops' treachery to his charioteer Myrtilus (Eur.
Or. 984.) Others read infidus, i. e. ‘qui prodiderit commissa fide‚' who had
divulged the secreta os Jupiter. Eur. Or. 9,-ἆκόλαστον ἔσχε γλῶσσαν.

71. Pectus...reczudere. γίνῃ. AE’n. x. 601.

76. cereas ivmqines. Theocr. 11. 28; Vir-9. Ecl. vm. 803 Ου. Ep. vl. 91,—
‘ Devovet absentes simulacraque cerea figit,
