94 NOTES ΟΝ THE ODES .· BOOK IV. 11, 111.

23. ᾖιὲοῗεὲ. e. his noble character3 like Shaltespeare's ‘ golden opinions,² Macheth,
. c. vn.

25. Multa, ‘¹ full and strong.” Tho stanza is expressed in Gmy’s Prome-ss osae-sy,
111. 3,- ‘ Ο ! Lyre divine, what dariug spirit
‘ Wakes thee now Ρ Though he inherit
‘ Nor the pride nor ample pinion
⁶ That the Theban eagle bear,
⁸ Sailing with supreme dominion
‘ Through the azure deep of air!

ib. Gymwm. Cp. Pope’s Temple of Fame,—
‘ Four swans sustain a car of silver might,

‘ With heads advanced and pinions stretched for flight ς
‘ Here... ...Pindar rode.'

27. Eyo, apis. Horace compares himself to the swan, in Can-m. Π. xx. 1-16. This
humbler comparison is after Luco-et. 111. 11.

85. samam clivum, a part of the Via Sacra, along which im‘mnphal processione
passed to the Capitol. (See more on Epod. vn. 7.)

36. Sygambros, on the Lower Rhine, between the Luppia fl. and Segus fl. (just ’
’ below Bonn.) The Romans had suffered defeats from the tribes in that

quartem and Augustus spent two years in Gaul to secure the frontier. See
chronol. Ταόῑο, B.c. 16-13.

37. Cp. Ov. ecc Ponte, Ι. 11. 100.
44. Forum litibus orbwm=a justitium. Cp. Cic. Leqy. 11. xu. 29.

49. Teque. Triumphus is here personified and addressed. Dum procedit, “while
Caesar moves on in procession.'' Cp. Ov. Trist. IV. 11. 4'7, sqq. Tuque dwm
procedis is another reading. It suits the context we115 and a change of per-
sons is avoided, Antony, the favour-ite of Augustus, is supposed to lead, or
take a prominent part in the procession; and he is again addressed (te decem)
in the following stanza. On the other hand (in.preserring the reading of the
text, and best MSS.) it appears that the abruptness in changing the address

is not too great for lyric poetry; and though Io Triumphe sounds more
naturally as an exclamation (Cp. Ov. Am. Ι. 11. 31), yet Triumphus is similarly

personified in Epod. Ix. 21, and the stanza may be taken as in parenthesis,

the regular structure of the Ode, as addressed to Antony, being returned to
111 v. .

57. Fronte curvatos, i. ο. with its horus (comibus primis, C'arm. 111. 1111. 4,)
sprouting like the partial crescent os the moon when three days old, and with
a white star on the forehead. Comp. Moschus, Id. 11. 84-88, (in the story of
Jupiter and Europa) 2—wfi δ’ ἤτοι τὸ μὲν ἄλλο δέμας ξανθόχροον ἔσκε,

Κύελος δέ ἕως μέσσῳ μόρμαιὲιε μετώπῳ

ἶσαΐ ἐπ’ ἀλλήλοισι κέρα ἀνέτελλε καρήνου,
Ἀντυγος ἡμιτόμου κεραῆς ἅτε κύκλα σελήνης.

CARM. III.—AD MELPOMENEN.

2. Hesiod, Theoq. 81‚—8mvoe τιμήσωσι Διὸς κοῦραι μεγάλοιο,
’γεινόμενόν τ’ ἐσίδωσι διοτρεφέων βασιλήων,
τῷ μὲν ἐπὶ γλώσσῃ γλυκερὴν χείουσιν ἐέρσην,
τοῦ δ’ ἔπε’ ἐκ στόματος ρεῖ μείλιχα.

With the poete, the look implied the favour of the divinities.
