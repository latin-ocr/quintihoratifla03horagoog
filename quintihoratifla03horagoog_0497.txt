NOTES ΟΝ ,THE EPISTLES .· BOOK Ι. EPIST. vt. 203

1. Compare Plutarch, Lise os Pericles,—‘ From him (sc. Anaxagoras) he learned
‘ to overcome those terrors which the various phenomena of the heavens raise‚'
&o.—Lc1n9horne's Transln.

On this subject we may perhaps refer to the prophecy of Jeremiah‚ x. 2.—
‘ Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not, dismayod ak the signs of hea-
‘ ven; for the heathen are dismayed at them?

2. Facere...beatum. On this term and these ethics consider St. Augustine’s word's
(Ser-m. 150, quoted in Worclsworth’s N. T„ on Acts xvn. 18),-‘ Dio, Epicureo,
‘ Quae res faciat beatum ? Responde ε Voluptas eorporis. Dio, Stoice ε Virtus
‘ animi. Dio, Christiane : Donum Dei:

10. Pavor is used of hope in Viry. G. 111. 106,—
‘ Exultantiaque haurit

‘ Corda pavor pulsans 3’
and Ov. Fast. 111. 362 3 and similarly too, extem-eo, as in γίνῃ. AEn. 11. 806.

11. Ειττενηαι is a oonjeotural reading, approved by Lachmann, Lacr. w. 1022.
[Q] in answer refers to Lacr. 11. 1040,—‘ novitate exterritus.' See δὺο

whole passage, vv. 1028—47.

12. Cp. Vir-9. AE'n. VI. 733‚—‘ Hinc metuunt cupiuntque, dolent gaudentque?

24. ΟΡ. Soph. Max, 647,—
ἅπανθ ὁ μακρὸς κᾶναρίθμητος χρόνος
φύει τ’ ἄδηλα καὶ φανέντα κρύπτεται.

31. Virtutem verba. This seems to be an allusion to Brutus’ dying words (given
in Dion. XLVII. odfin.) ,··-ὧ τλῆμον ἀρετὴ, λύμη ἄρ’ ἦσθ’ “ ἐγὼ δὲ σὲ ὣς ἔργον
ἤσκουν, σὺ δ’ ἄρ’ ἐδούλευες τύχῃ. Compare Shakespeare’s (Hamlet, Act ΙΙΙ.
Sc. lv.)‚—‘ Such a deod... ...sweet religion makes a rhapsody of words!

32. Lucum liqna. Observe the alliteration, as in virtutem verba. The general
sense is‚—“ Do you think there is no reality in virtue ; that it. is a matter of
“ mere words Ρ 11· so, then be not, controlled by it, but follow your own desires
‘⁸ unscrupulously.”

ib. Ne portus occupet. Cp. Cic. de Off. 111. ΧΠ. 3.

post Red. Π. The king of Cappadocia at this time was Archelaus ; he reigned
from Β. c. 36 until A. 1). 17, and the kingdom was then reduoed fio a Roman
province. (Tac. Anu. 11. xmr.) Some have thought that Ariobarzanes, whom
Cicero calls perpauper, (cml Att. VI. 111.) is alluded to here. He had been put
to deassh by Cassius Β. c. 42.

«10. Ii‘uculgts. This passage is quoted, and the story told‚in Plutarch's Life of
