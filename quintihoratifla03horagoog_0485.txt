NOTES ΟΝ THE SATIRES: BOOK II. SAT. vn, v111. 191

107. Νοπῳο-τ“ the fact is, you are not impunitior, for,” διο. With the sentiment,
compare Juv. 1. 142,—
‘ Poena tamen praesens, cum tu deponis amiotus
‘ Tui-gidus et crudum pavonem in balnea portas.
‘ Hinc subitae mortes,' etc.
And so Athenoeus, p. 429, quoting Alexis (Φρύξ 1, Mentem),—
εἷ τοῦ μεθύσκεσθαι πρότερον τὸ κραιπαλᾶν
‘superbae' ἡμῖν, οὐδ’ ἃν εἷς οἶνόν ποτε
προσίετο πλεῖον τοῦ μετρίου.

110. Proedia vendit. Compare ‘ comedunt patrimonia,’ Juv. 1. 138.

111. servile yuloe parens. γνάθον τε δοῦλος νηδύος θ’ ἡσσημένος, Eurip. Autol. Fr.
1. 5. Comp. ἀνδραποδώδεις, Χεπ. Mem. Ι. 1. 16.

113. Ponere. Used here of time, as elsewhere of money, “to lay out; to turn to
good aeeount.'’ So in Pliny, Ep. lv. 23,—‘ Disponere otium.⁹

117. Versus facit. Satirically made a synonym for insanit. Comp. Ars Poet. 296.
Dryden's lines are famous,—
‘ Great wits are sure to madness near allied,
‘ And thin partitions do their bounds divide.²
Absalom and Ahithophel.

118. ΟΡονα-τορενανίιις. Compare the tbi-eat, εἷς μυλῶνα, Ewr. Cycl. 240.

SATIRE VIII.

This is the account os a supper given by Nasidienus Rufus, a vain, rich
gourmand. The nas-ration is in the mouth of the comio poet Fundanius, who
was among the guenta. The entertainment appears to have been conspicuous
for vulgar display; and the host’s affected, and perhaps blundering, gastro-
nomy is ridiculed throughout. Much of the description may be compared
with the rules of the Fourth Satire.

2. Here. Quintilian attests this form, as having supplanted the older heri ‚- which
ΙΙιοζνιείνοὲὲ was the form retained ‘ in epistolis Augusti, quas sua manu scripsit P'

3. De medio-..clia Cp. Epist. 1. ΧΠ. 34: i. e. ‘ solito maturius,’ asin Juv. xl. 88.
The usual hour of the cem was three. So Ep. 1. vu. 71. Se, ‘ ab octava bibit-,⁹
Juv. 1. 49, is an instance of excess. See also Carm. Ι. 1. 20.

4. FS'uevgtlvn-elius.l98at. 11. 11. 120,—· bene erat,’ “ Ι never enjoyed myself more.”
o e ow, υ. .

5. Compare the expression of “extreme hunger ’' in Viry. AEn. 11. 356,-‘ Improba
‘ ventris Exegit caecos rabies)

7. Ccnae pater. See Merivale’s History os Rome, vol. IV. ch. xm. p. 554 : he remarks
on this as the Roman term, in contrast to the Greek one of Sym posim-ch, or
(as Germ. Ι. lx.) Thaliarchus.

11. &ffir- subligit. The slave, whose office this was, is called analecta by Martial,
14. Hydnssss, ise. an Indian page. Comp. Carm. 1. xm. 7.

15. Mans expers. This is explained to mean either “ a home-made wine,” to
imitate the Chian3 or ‘⁸ without sea-water,” an ingredient of frequent use in
flavouring wines. But neither of these meanings gives, as the general con-
text requires, an idea os wealth or vulgar display. The first explanation also
seems overthrown by υ. 48, where ‘⁶ Chian '’ is directly opposed to “ home-
made wine.'' Persius, uses the phrase (Sat. vl. 39), and indicates the meaning.
