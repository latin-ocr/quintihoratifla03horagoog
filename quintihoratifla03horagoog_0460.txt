166 NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SATIRES: BOOK 11. ΕΔΤ. 1.

71. Δ volqo et scena, ι’. e. “from being in public.’' Cp. Cio. ad Brut. Ep. 1. 11. 2,
“ Tibi 8889 populo et 99989881 dicitur, serviendum es‘t.’

73. op. cic. decrat. ιι. 6, (22.)

ib. Discincti. A compound, the contrary of praecinctus and succinctas, nearly“ in
undressss’ i. e. without ceremony or reserve.

74. Olus, i. e. “their frugal ῐ8981.” See Cic de Pin. 11. 8, (quoting Lucilius),—
Ὀ lapathe, ut jactare 899 99 sati' cognitu' qui sis. In quo Laelia, clamores

‘sophos ille solebat Edere, compellans gumias ex ordine nostres& (and
adding)—‘ Praeclare Laelius et recte ‘”sophos.

¹7⁷. quili...solido, “ and when thinking to strike its tooth into 8 soft morscl, will

“ come upon 8 hard 989 ς’· i. e. when expecting to find 88 easy prey, it will
find it 1189 met its match.

ib. Fraqili-:quod ,ἧι-81191· potest, 89. 89 8 1181 between the teeth. Or perhaps the
metaphor is drawn from the ‘ Viper and the Fue?

79. Diffindere. The general sense 91· this is clear,-“ 1 cannot object to, I agree
with, what you say.” Diffindere is on the whole the most 111-91181119 reading 2
it is 8 legal term, and therefore in character. Diem or rem diffindere was
equivalent to differ-rm hence Gesner makes the sense to be,—“ the 9899 19
” 99 91981, Ι need not defer judgment; Ι 988 decide 81 9899.” Β81 Fea (with
whom Orelli agrees) considers that, though the word 119911· may have been

suggested by technical usage, it may be intended to have here 8 different and
8 9918189891 99899, viz. “ to reject, or put aside.'’

Other editions have diffinyere‚ “ 1ο 88(19 or alter ;” defrinyere‚ “ to break off 8
piece,” in allusion to the metaphor fraqili.

(Deflndere, definqere, ἀρήροτο, ἀιζῆίῃενθ, diffidere, diffundere, are instanoos of tho
ingenuity of correctore.)

80. Ut may be taken 9111191· with monitu.. or caveas, the latter seems the most

natural construction. “That you may be sase from any evil consequenccs
“⁶1'rom ignorance 91· 1119 law, (remember)’' etc.

82. Si mala, etc. The terms of the law in the Twelve Tables 819 quoted by

(licere, de Rep. Π. 10,-’ xn. tabulae cum perpaucas res capite sanxissent in

‘ his 11889 quoque sanciendam putaverunt, siquis occentavisset sive 98118911 998-
’ didisset qued infamiam faceret flagitiumve alteri.'

ib. Jus...judiciumque. See article 'Jndeae' in Dict. Ant.; and Adam’s R. A. p.
246, —‘ The things done in court before the appointment of jmlices were
‘properly said in juro sim, after that in Judicio,· but this distinction 19 not al·
‘ways observed! Jus judiciumque was scemingly 88 indefinite double phrase

(cp. Liz.xxx1x.2·;1) but Orelli paraphrases it thus‚—‘ Lex Cornelia lata est,
‘ct 89119 injuriarum 18 9818 datur!

83. Μαῖα. Used punningly. Cp. the Greek Epigram 91· Pallam,—

καλῶς εἰπεῖν Ἀττικόν ἐστι μέλι.

85. Latraverit. Bentley reads laceraverit, without advantage or authority. Latro

basan 899. 9899 18 Epod. v. 58. The metaphor is found Epod. V1.l; and in
Mo. xxxvnl. 54,—‘ Cato allatravit Scipionis magnitudinem!

ib. 12115199ιῖ1· ipse, “being himself 91981 from 181111,υ 98 1119 principle 91· Sat. Ι. 111.

86. “Τ119 charges will be quashed by the general laugh· you will get offst'
(Μ tems-‘dimissius not necessarily absolutus.)

ib. Risu solvere. Cp. Quintil. V. x. 67, — ‘Cum risu tota res solvitur? and see the
quot. on saal . x. 14. With the · passage generally, comp. Arist. Vesp.
1257, “Isp— ἢ ’γὰρ παρῃτήσαντο τὸν πεπονθότα
ᾖ λόγον ἔλεξας αὐτὸς ἀστεῖόν τινα
