SATIRE IV.

'I'ms contains the poet's defence of himself aud his poetry against dett-action.

Iu the opening he describes the rise of Roman satire (vv. 1—14), ridicules
Crispi1(:1us and the reciters of the day, and claime not to be confounded with
them vv. 14-24.)

He rates his own protensione modestly, and glauces at the character of a
true poet (v. 39, sqq.)

He justifies candid and friendly raillery (vv. 68- 91,) as contrasted with self-
ish and ill-natured wit (v. 81, sqq.; v. 100.)

Τ11611, paying a tribute to his father’s excellence (v. 105‚) who ever deteri-ed
him from vice and solly by example (the true purpose, with regan-d ιο ι116
publio, of legitimate satire), and inculcating by his own practice a habit of
reflectiveness and self-correction, he skilsully recurs (v. 140) to his original
subject, and winds up with the assertion and maintenance of poets' rights.

12. Cp. Pers. 1. 123-4.

2. Comoedia prisca. Cp. Ars Poet, 281. The rise of Comedy was later, by a
generaffion, than that of ngedy. There were three divisions of it, marked
by the refinements successively introduced by teste or by publio opinion:
The Old Comedy, which, 111 its nnrestricted license, dealt with real persons
and facts : 2. Τ116 Middle Comedy, in which the facts were real, but the names
fictitious: 3. Τ116 N ew Comedy‚ in which both facts and names were
fictitious. The distinction of Old and N ew is marked by Armene, Eth. N. Π.

4. sicarius. σικάριος, N. T.

5. Cum libertate. Cum is apparently pleonastic, but it gives the sense of notabant
idque liberrime. (On the apparent ellipse of cum, see Waqner’s note on Vim.
AEn. lv. 517 ε on the addition of cum, see Mad-v. Gr. ξ 257.) With the idea
and the phrase, compare Cic. ad Fam. XII. xvi. 3. Juvenal asks (S. 1. 151),—

‘ Unde illa priorum
‘ Scribendi quodcumque animo flagrante liberet ’
‘ Simplicitas Ρ ’
