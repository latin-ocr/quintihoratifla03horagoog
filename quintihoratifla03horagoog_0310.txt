ib. cerea, “ smooth, delicate ;” or it may be “waxen in colour.” Cp. the use of
wax as a cosmetio,—‘ Inducta candorem quaerere cera.² Ου. Α. Α. 111. 199.

4. Hom. Il. ι. 642‚—oladnm κραδίη χόλῳ.

6. Manet. Orelli supporta the reading manent, inconsistently with his own remark
on Carm. 1. xxiv, 8. Bentley considers it a mere copyist's correction, and
shows that the Latin usuage does not admit a plural verb after nouus coupled
by negativos. Madvig quotes (Lat. Gr. s. 213) an exception, from Terence, Ad.
Ι. 11. 23, where the nominatives are of different persons. His quotation of
Cicero is at least doubtful. An instance of the construction in Greek may be
found in Eur. Alcest. 360, quoted by Person on Hec. 86. Instances of ἠ ...... ἡ,
followed by a plural, are found in Hom. Ι l. v, 1383 AEsch. Suppl. 727. As an
instance of Horatian usage, comp. C. 111. x. 16‚—‘ curvat?

ib. Humor. Wagner writes ‘ wnwr, umidus .·’ but Varro (de L. Lat. υ. 241) retains
the aspirato, deriving the word from ‘ lemnus? His authority is good for the
fact, if not for the root. If the true root is χέω, χυμός, there is reason for the h.

8. Macero. Used again, Epod. ιη’. 16. Properly, ‘·· to sosten by steeping ;”
hence, “ to waste or wear away.” Cp. Theoer. 111. 17 ,-ἓρωτα .........
ὃς με κατασμύχων καὶ ἐς ὀστέον ἄχρις ἰάπτει.

‘ abia-et Quem facit impresso mutua dente Venus.' '

15. caval. 1011. 2,--‘ Saviolmn dulci dulcius ambrosia!

16. Quinta parte, may be represented by ‘⁸ quintessence,” the modern, but obsolete
term of chemistry, expressing spirit rectified to the utmost, (tle. the essence
from fimo distillatione.) The phrase in Horace is probably adapted from the
Aristotelian-notion of a πέμπτη οὐσία, (the ‘ quintum qenus e quo essent astra
mentesque! Cic. Acad. 1. 8 ; where see Davie’ nota) viz. ·‘ a fifth and superior
element or essence,'' the etherial.

17. This may be taken from Homer od. ζ. 181,—
ὁμοφροσύνην ὀπάσειαν (sc. θεοὶ)
ἐσθλήν · οὗ μὴν γὰρ τοῦ γε κρεῖσσον καὶ ἄρειον
ἦ ὅθ’ ὁμοφρονέοντε νοήμασίν οἶκον ἔχητον

CARM. x1V.—AD REMPUBLICAM.

In Sextum Pompeium civile bellum renovantem.

That this is an nHegory is clear3 and it is quoted as such by Quintilian, VIII.
vx. 44. That it is (in part) an imitation of Almus, Fraym. 18, is also clear3 but
whether it is rightly referred to Pompeius (as in the title,) or to what conjunctum
of events it does belong, is and must be doubtful. See however the Essay, trans-
lated by Buttmann, in the Philoloqical Muscam, Vol.. 1. p. 483. There it is
supposed that Horace is addressing the party who with him had fought under
