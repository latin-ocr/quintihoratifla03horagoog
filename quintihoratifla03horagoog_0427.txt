NOTES ΟΝ THE SATIRES .- BOOK Ι. SAT. 1. 133

91. In C'amp0, sc. Martio, i. e. as a racer. Cp. C. Ι. vln. 8. Keightley suggests a

92. Denique sit finis, ‘⁸ in fine, let a definite limit be set to your pursuit of wealth.”
Observa how this verse connects itself with vv. 106-7: “Such a limit is a
“principle in nature, and the neglect os it is inconsistent with rectitude.'’

ib. Cumque habeas plus, “ since you have more than before ;” as parto quod avebas,
‘⁴ having obtained your original desire,’' i. e. a competency.

96. Ut metiretur. This phrase was proverbial, to signify “great riches’' (or, ac·
cording to Suidas, v. μέδιμνος, “great expectations.”) So Xenophon, Heu.
III. 11. 27, expresses the wealth of Xenias os Elis, τὸν λεγόμενον μεδίμνῳ

ἀπομετρήσασθαι τὸ παρὰ τυῦ πατρὸς ἀργύριον. Pliny, N. H. xxxv. 36, relates
that Apelles was paid for his Alexander 20 talento, mensu-ra no‘n numm.

100. Fwtisszzm Tyndaridarum, i. e. “like a clytemnestra.'’

102. L. Ouirisiuslfo-mggtanus, proverbial with Horace for his extravagance. Sat. I.
V111. 3 . 1. .

ib. Peryis, etc. The sense is,-“ That is quite another point : you argue as if the
“alternative lay between extremes; you bring contraries together front to
“front.'' c'mnponere is a metaphor from the gladiatoria] school; see Sat.1.
vn. 20. [O.] ΊῙξοπίίότιε adversis might be a metaphor from a buJJ fight, as.
Virq. AEn. ΧΠ. 1 ,--

‘ Cum duo conversis inimica in proelia tauri
⁸ Frontibus incurrunt ;’

but simply expresses direct opposition, as in Imeret. vt. 117,—‘ Concurrere
nubes frontibus adversis possint-..¹

104. Vappam...ac nebulonem. Vappa was properly “ wine,” or rather “ vinegar,”
which had lost all its acid and taste. Nebulo is from nebula, “ mist, cloud.”
They describe, therefore, a wasteful and worthless character.

105. This is said by the Scholiast to be a Greek proverb.

108. “I come back to my first point, viz. that men in their covetousness are

ib. Nemo ut, i. e. ut nemo. ‘Pro accus. cum infinitivo, ut Sat. Ι. ,ΙΠ. 115,’ Orelli.
The construction is apparently repeated from his first sentence (v. 1),-‘ Fit...
ut πεπιο contentus vivat? Nemon’ ut...? is the reading of many MSS. and
Editions‚ but has all the appearance of being a mere correction, and the
interrogative construction is out of place in a summary of reasonings.

110. Cp. Ov. A. A. 1. 350‚-—‘ Vicinumque pecus grandius uber habet!

114. Ut cum carceribus. ιΟΡ. Viry. Geor. 1. 512 ς Ου. A. Am. 111. 595,—

‘ Tum bene fortis equus reserato carcere currit,
‘ Cum quos praetereat, quosque sequatur habet!

The carceres were the inclosed vaults or stalla, in which chariots and horsea
were ranged, for starting in the race. They (or their doors) are called ‘ spatiis
obstantia claustra' in Epist. Ι. xlv. 9.

119. Lucret. 111. 951‚-‘ Cur non, ut plenus vitae conviva, recedis?’ and 970-973.
Cp. the use of this figure in Sir W. Scott’s Anne of Geierstein, ch. xv,—·‘ Death
‘is dreadful. . ‚but in the first spring-tide os youth...to be snatched sorcibly from
‘ the ·banquet to which the individual has but just sat down, is peculiarly
