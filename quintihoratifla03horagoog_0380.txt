CARM. xxvm.—AD LYDEN.

1. Die Neptuni, i. e. decimo Calendas Sextiles, July 23.

3. Lyde. The name occurs before, Carra. xl. 7. Strenua, i. e. “quickly, without

4. Adhibe νίηι, i. e. ‘⁴ lay siege to.”

navit! [0.] Cp. Vir-9. AEn. vxu. 280,—‘ devexo.. Olympo!

6. stet. cp.Tibull.1.1v 27, (Lachmann's reading, see his note, Lucr. 111. 1042),-
‘At si tardu( ris errabis: transiet aetas
‘Quam cito! non segnis stat remeatque dies!

‘’Stare dies.'

8. Bibuli Consum. Bibulus was Consul n.c. 59, with Julius Caesar, a consulate
characterized by the epigram (Suet. J. O. 20),—
‘ Non Bibulo quicquam nuper sed Caesare factum est;
‘ Nam Bibulo fieri consule nil memini!

(Cla-ss.Journ.xx1.p.252')

ib. Nenia. This word is said by Cicero to be os Greek origin,—‘ Honoratorum
‘virorum laudes ιιι contione memorent, easque etiam cantu, ad tibicinem pro-
‘ sequatur, cui nomen neuim, quo vocabulo etiam Graecis cantus lugubres
⁵ ‘ nominantur! De Leyy. 11. 24. It is conjectured by Pott to be akin to νηνέως
if correctly, we may infer that the proper radical notion of it was not
“ mourning, ’⁹ as is commonly represented, but ‘⁴ accumulation, or repetition. '’
And this notion is common to all its meanings, however varied or disconnectcd
they seem. For“ repetition'' forms the character and essence, whether of a
eulogy (asin Cicero, 1. c) or of a lament or dirge (asin Carm.11.1x. 21,) or
of pathos m poetry (as in Garm.11.1.38,) or of a soothing evening lullaby (as
here, according to Orelli· s explanation, χ ‘cantilena...ad somnum invitante,' ) or
of a proverbial saying or ‘ old song,' (as in E. Ι. 1. 63.)

CARM. xxm—AD MAECENAT ΕΜ.

ib. Parricidoe. The cyclic legend related, that Telegonus, having set out ιιι search
of his father, was thrown upon the coast of Ithaca by storms, and, upon being
attacked by Ulysses‚ slew him without knowing who he was. His spear is
said to have been pointed with a fish- -spine or prickle (a kind of weapon com·
mon at this day’ ιιι the South Scae. )
