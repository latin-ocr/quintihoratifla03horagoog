238 NOTES ΟΝ THE ‘Ales POETICAJ

It is known that J. Cmsar planned the draiuing of the Pomptino Marsh, und

a canal to Tarracina3 and if Augustus proposed or comment-ed in eux-nest the
completiou of those plans, the panegyrical allusion here made would be both

natural and naturally expressed.

(35. Palus. The shortening of the last syllable is a singular licence; but it is
recognised and attested by Servius on Virq. AEn. 11. 69; VI. 107.

70. Cecidere, cadentque, a phrase from Luc-ret. 111. 969.

75.,Impariterjunct1's. See Ov. Am. 1. 1. 27,—
‘ Sex mihi surgat opus numeris, in quinque residat ε

‘ hiusa, per undenos emodulanda pedes!-
76. Voti sententio compos, “ successful love.”

80. C'othurni. Cp. Ου. Am. 111. ι. 11—14: θ
‘ Venit et ingenti violenta Tragoedia passm

‘ L}dius aits. pedum vincla cothurnus erat)

81, 82. Aristone on Poetry (see the translation in Theatra os the Greeks) describes
the iambic metre as μάλιστα λεκτικὸν (colloquial) τῶν μέτρων, ch. Π. and
πρακτικὸν (adapted to action and business), ch. xxnr.

83, 84. See the description of Pindar’s poems, and their varieties, in cam. IV.
11. 10-24. Cp. Carm. 1. 111. 1.

86. Colores, metaphor for “character or cast of poeti-y 3⁹⁹ and so, in speaking of
oratoru, Cicero says‚—-‘ Habitum orationis et quasi colorem.‘ De Orat. 111. 52,
3953 312ut36331. 25, (96, 100.) Again, ‘Sentio orationem...quasi colorum-i.⁸

91. Cena Thyestae—ovinae δαῖτα παιδείων κρεῶν. AEsch. Aqam. 1242. Cassandra
sees it (in her mind’s eye), Ibid. vv. 1096, 1217. Cp. cic. de Off. 1. 28-ι Natis
sisaulllcshro ipse est parcns! A line spoken by Atreus iu a play (supposed) of

94. Delitiqat, ‘⁸ gives fun vent to his wrath.” De, properly “ down from,n pasees
into the sense of “ going forward, right on to the end.'¹

97. Αηηηιῖῖαε. Cp. Ep. 1. 111. 14,--“inflated, affected phrases.'' (Ampulla was
literally ‘⁶ a flask or cruet, os protuberant shape.'’) So Cicero (ad Att. 1. xlv.
3) uses λήκυθους of his own rhetorical flourishes. The verb pirum-e, there
used iu connection with it, and the Scholium quoted by Orelli, ‘quasi ex
colorum ac pigmentorum vase λήκυθῳ,’ seem to point to another origin sor
the metaphor, viz„ the contonts, rather than the shape of the lecythus, as a
colon-rinq or msmetic vase. The sense would then be rather fine than swelliuq
language, but would express Cicero's λήκυθος more correctly than Horace’s
ampulla.

³8· Cp· Pers· ι. 91, ‘ Verum nec nocte puratum
‘ Plorabit qui me volet incurvasse querella?

100. Quocumque volent. Cp. Cicero cle Oratore, 1. 8, (30)‚—‘Voluntates impellere
‘ quo velit, unde autem velit deducere.¹

104. Malo...mandata. Some edd. construe ‘male with loqueris,- forgetting that the
rules here given are designed for tho poet, not for the players. (So v. 112.)
One is reminded of Hamlet’s mle, though that is addressed to actores—¹ Suit
‘ the action to the word, the word to the action)

105. Domnitabo. Cp. Cic. cle ΟΖ. Orat. 80, (278),-‘ Somnum isto loco vix
tenebamus) (There, wc may observe, the fault imputcd lay in the deliver5‚
not the diction os the speaker, Calidius.)
