NOTES ΟΝ THE SATIRES: BOOK 11. 8:17⁷. 111, lv.

313. Tantum. Al. tanto, which, however, cannot be used adverbially‚ except with

a comparative, and, taken otherwise, is awkward. Tantum is used as in v.
317, and as multum (e. g. v. 147), for tam.

315. Denuo-rat. ‘Ordine et plene narrat,’ orell. Cp. the explanation of definge,

ib.

Sat. Ι. x. 37. Cp. delitiyffi ‘⁴ to rail without ceasing‚'' A. Ρ. 94.
Ut, ‘⁴ how ;’' not ‘⁸ that.''

⁷26. Major...minori. There seems a double sense intendeds—-major, scil„ υἰείοτία

vel insania.

SATIRE IV.

This Satire may rcmind the readers of Smollett of the Feast in the Manuer
os the Ancients, in Pei-cyrino Pickle.

It contains a sti-ing of precepts, burlesque often in meaning as well as
manner, upon cookery. They are delivered as a lecture by Catius (perhaps
an imaginary person, perhaps the “ Soyer'’ of his day), in formal philosophie
style, beginning ab ovo (υ. 12), and running through cabbages and tough hens,
mushrooms and mulberries, shell-fish, solids, wine, and sances, whatever pro·
vokes appetite or promotes digestion. They conclude (υ. 76) with reflectione
upon misplaced parsimony, and the neglect of (supposed) minor points,
essential really to comfort and refinement.

1. Catius. Cicero mentions an Epicurean of this name ς and it has been thought

that Horace intended in his person to satit-ise that sect. But there is no real
ground for identifying the two; and the drift of the satire evidently bears
upon a prevailing folly, not any philosophie peculiarities.

Orelli has inserted, with much probability, from the Scholiast's expression—-
‘irridet eum qued de opere pistorio in sno libro scribit de se ipso ε Hoec
‘primus invenit et coquet-it Casius Miltiades ’-that this speaker was Catius’
sreedman, who had really written a cookery·book, and to whom therefore these
maxims might be attributed, with some chance of taking in the gastronomical
professore, who affected to know and retail the secrete of Moecenas' kitchen.
ln reference to the style of the speaker, Orelli (on -υ, 3) aptly quotes Athenaeus,
vn. 36,--Ἀλαζονικόν ἐστι πᾶν τὸ τῶν μαγείρων φῦλον.

2. Ponere siqua. Orelli andex-stands the phrase of “assigning a character and

place in the memory to‚'' according to the Memoria rech-nica os Simonides,-
his Art of Memor-y is described at length by Cicero in two passages: Aa
Her-evm. 111. 16 (28), sqq. ς and de orat. 11. 86 (351), sqq. In his exposition of
its method-—a method traced out. from τι principle of luminous arrangement,
viz. the perception (353) ‘ ordinem esse maxime qui memoriae lumen afferret ’
—he lays down, that rooms or niobes are to be marked ont in the memory
(354),-‘ locos esse capiendos, et ea, qum memoria tenere vellent, effingenda.
animo atque in his locis collocanda 3’ in which are to be rauged the casts or
sliapcd modcls of ideas and things. These niches he compares to writing
tablets, the casts or shapes to letters,—‘ loci cerae aut chartoe simillimi sunt,
imagines litteris ⁹ (ad Her. 30) ς ‘locis pro cera, simulacris pro litteris
uteremur} (de Or. 354, cp. 360). The subjecte of knowledge, or conceptions
of the mind, may be thus presented to the eye of the understanding in a
substantial form, likeness, or shape,—‘ Res caecas...conf0rmatio quoedam et
imago et figura notaret ' (357).

In accordance with this system, we find litteris consiqwe used side by side,
and as if parallel, with in animo insculpere, in the account of Lucullus and his
power of memory. Cic. Acad. 11. 2‚—‘ Ut litteris consignamus quae moni-
‘ mentis mandare volumus, sic ille in animo res insculptas habebat?
