CARM. XXV.—-AD BACCHUM.

For true lyrica] spirit, this Ode is unrivnlled. We may, perhaps, except the
third of Book IV; but this is bolder and more passionnte in character. Its
structure is abrupt, consisting of short, rapid, nervous sentences3 a. thing to
be considered, in determining the question disputed at υ. 12. 1 heve decided
on retaining the punctuation of Gesner and the older editors, on poetio as

among ...... ’³ The poet represents himself as doing that, the doing of which he

ib. Consilio, “ the court, or chosen counsellors” of Jove. Concilio would have a

ing “ on the heights ”) or object, so as to depend on stupet (us in Sat. 1. vl.
17.) The former construe-tion seems preferable, as the objects are mentioned
in υ. 10 ; and it seems confirmed by Ox'id's imitation, Trist. IV. ι. 41,—
