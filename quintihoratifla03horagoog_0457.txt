NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SATIRES: BOOK 11. SAT. 1. 163

Q. HORA'PI FLAOOI SATIRAE.

LIBER. SECUNDUS.

SATIRE I.

ΤΗΒ second book opens with a kind of apology for the practice of satir-ic
composition. It takes the form os a consultation with the old lawyer Tre·
batius Testa, whose hints and cautious are given with much humour, and
some allusion to his peculiarities, as in vv. 8, 9.

Trebatius recommends, first, the abandoning composition, or secondly,
recourse to a different style of poen-5, e. 9. epic or descriptive. The poet re-
plies, that his instinct for verse is irrepressible‚ yet that he is incapable of a
higher ssight. (Compare Epist. 11. 1. 250, sqq.) He defends himself by
asserting his freedom from all malice, and his fairness of purpose; a resolu-
tion to attack no one unprovoked, though he will defend himself, (v. 39, sqq.)
He is like his own native town in this (Venusia, v. 36), having been
colonised originally for a desence upon the frontier. Finally‚ he recurs
(v. 62) to the example of Lucilius, whom he had nmationed before as his
model (v. 29, sqq.)‚· and is confident of finding for himself the support and
friendship with which Scipio and Laelius honoured and encouraged him.

(Pope has imitated this Satire, and the Second and Sixth.)

4. Dedgei. ²Pope has preserved the metaphor,—‘ Lord Fanny spins a thousand such
a ay.

ib. Trebati. C. Trebatius Testa, well known through his intimacy with Cicero,

(as in Arist. Nab. 1215.) cp. Livy, xxx. 29‚—‘ Optimum quidem fuerat,' etc.

ib. Ter...transnanto...habento. These terminations are proper to a formal legal
style of injunction3 and in the rule itself is a sly allusion to the old lawyer’s
love of the water, and os good living: for which traits see Cic. (ul Fam. v11.
x. 2‚—‘ Studiosissimus homo natandi ς’ and VII. χχιι, ⁴ inter scyphos‚’ etc.

14. Fracta ..czmpida This is said by the Schol. to be an allusion to the device
adopted by Marius against the Cimbri. Sec Plutarch’s Life ns C. Murius, 25.
