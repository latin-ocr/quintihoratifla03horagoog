24. Et peccare, etc. “ the principle of looking on vice(peccare)as a thing to be rejected
with abhorrence, or else (aut) reeompensed by death.'' This is Gesner's in·
terpretation, according to which υυ. 21-24 form but one sentence and sentiment,
and therefore est is not to be repeated 3 while e in emori may be understood
as conveying an emphatic meaning of utter, instant death, as a privilege and
relies under the shame of what is intolerable. If est ‘mm-i is adopted, there
must be a stop after castitas, and a break in the context3 and the meaning
will be “ and sin is abhorred‚ or else the penalty is death ;” τῖε. the adulteress
is put to death by her relatives. This is Orelli’s method. The doubt about
the reading and the variation in MSS. may have arisen from ὅ being often an
abbreviation for est. Again, Sanadon believes that est is the interpolation of
one who did not see that v. 24 might be referred back to the est in v. 21. And
undoubtedly emori gives a more difficult, and perhaps poetical, construction,
and therefore might invite alteration.

[0.] ean hardly be said to determine the meaning of enmri by his citations.
In Cicero, emori seems to be a mere substitution for mori, on account os the
metre ε in Columella, ewrwri is ‘⁴ to die away.'’ The natural force of e in
emoriar would be either intensive, or denoting escape, (ia. “ to die outright,
or to get away by death.'’) Compare Plau& Aulul. IV. v. 1,--‘ Emortuom ego
me mavelim leto malo.’
