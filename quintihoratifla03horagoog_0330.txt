14. Mareotico. Cleopatra's mind is said to be oven-set, not by a deity's (e.9. Pan or
Apollo's) intervention, but by wine; a reflection on her luxury and its effecte.

‘ ...to sail far away to some secure regions beyond the reach of the conqueror,
‘whose pursuit she dreaded.' Had the impf. (nec reparabat) been used, it
would have meant she did not purpose or attempt to fly, whioh would have
been untrue.

and a fine imitation of this ode 2-

‘ He (Char-les I.) nothing common did or mean,
‘ Upon that momorable scene,

‘ The axe’s edge did try ς
‘ Nor call'd the gods with vulgar spito
‘ To vindicato his helpless right3
