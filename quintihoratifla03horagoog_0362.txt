70 NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ODES: BOOK ΙΙΙ. v1.

CARM. VL—AD ROMANOS.

An Ode inveighing against the corruptions of the age.

1. Delicta, properly “ neglects,” “ things left undone,'’ used in S. 1. 111. 79, 1413
A. Ρ. 442. ‘ Deliquit,’ S. Ι. 111. 84. With the sentiment, compare, Eurip. Pr.
Alcm- 17,-τὰ τῶν τεκόντων ὥς μετέρχεται θεὸς μιάσματα. [0.] quotes as from
Eur. Fr. Inc. 133 (a verse which 1 cannot find‚)—-⁴r& τῶν τεκόντων σφάλματ’ εἷς
τοὺς ἐκγόνους οἱ θεοὶ τρέπουσι.

2. Romane. Cp. Vir-9. AEn..v1. 852. Used poetically in a collective sense.

ib. Templa roseam-is. The care of Augustus for these works is mentioned by Sue-
tonius, Auq. 30,—‘AEdes sacras vetustate collapsas aut incendio absumptas
⁸ refecit,’ etc. Ovid affirms the same, Fast. 11. 59-63. No doubt, by his
frequent recum-enee to this subject, as well as to the other reforms attempted
at this period, Horace designed not to please or compliment Augustus so
much as to influence public opinion in support of his administration, and of
the measures which promised any hope of recovering the country from its
demoralisation, or infusing a genereus and patriotic spirit among the tul-ing
classes.

5. ia. “ 'l'he power of Rome is owed to the favour of heaven, and based upon
religion.” Cic. Nat. D. 111. 2,—‘ Quae (sc. civitas) numquam profecto sine
‘ summa placatione Deorum imm. tanta esse potuisset ς’ and, de Hanoep. resp.
9. [Μ.] quotes from Camillus’ speech, Liv. v· 513 and from Appius’, Ἡ. 41.

9. Mmses et Pacori manu-s. Pacorus was the son of Orodes (Arsaces XIV.) king
- of Parthia. The two defeats (bis) here spoken of must be that of Crassus in
ne. 53, and that of Decidius Saxa, thirteen years later, when Pacorus com·
manded. It is not known who this Monaeses vva-0³3 but the name occurs more
than once among the Parthian nobles, and it is thought that he may be the
same with Surena, and Surena possibly the titular, Monaeses the personal,
name. Surena was the commander at Carrhae.

10. Non auspicatos. True, in the litei-al sense, of Crassus. Livy, Π. 41 (referred
to on υ. 5) expresses the Roman estimato of ‘ auspicia,'—‘ Auspiciis hanc
‘ urbem conditam, auspiciis bello ac pace domi militiaeque omnia geri quis est
‘ qui ignoret P· Especially Cic. Dicin. 1. 18,—‘ N ihil...nisi auspicato :...st Crasso
‘ quid acciderit videmus, dirarum obnuntiatione neglecta!

12. Renidet, “rejoices ;” properly, “shines back, glistens.” Cp. from φάος and
φαίνω, the signification ‘⁴ cheerful, joyous,'' in φαιδρός, φαιδρωπός, φαιδρύνει.

14. Dacus. ‘Conjurato descendens Dacus ab Histro: Via-9. Gom-9. 11. 497. There
were ware with the Dacian and Moesian tribes in Re. 30 or 29. M. L. Crassus,
proconsul in Macedonia, celebrated a triumph for them in Β. c. 29. AEthiops‚
the Egyptians, i.e. in the fleet of Antony.

19. Hoc sonte...clades (Cp. ewp. v. 13.) Rome is her own greatest enemy. Oomp.
shake-sp. Κάφις John, concluding speech,—
‘ This England never did nor never shall
‘ Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,
‘ But when it first did help to wound itself!

21. Μοΐιιε...Ιοπίοοε, “ Greek dances.'’ The Ionians were looked on as effeminate,
even in Greece. (See Grote’s Hist. vol. [v. ch. xxxv.) Ἰωνικῶς ἰΒε-ἆβρῶς in
Arist. Thesm. 163. So in Proper-t. Ι. v1. 31,—‘ Mollis Ionia ;’ and, perhaps, in
Ov. Ep. 11. 73, ‘Ioniacas puellas’ involves the same allusion. In Aristoph.

l. c. (see Toup's note) the verb διεκλῶντο gives at least some reason for reading
here sranqitue· artubus.
