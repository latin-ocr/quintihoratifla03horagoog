64. Prensore. Pressare is a reading, seemingly of less authority. Orelli says of it,—
‘ Sic dedi cum Schol. et Codd. aliq. Postquam volsa erant brachia prensam·
‘jam vix poterant sed pressari, nisi statues ὕστερον πρότερον) Yet the attempt
expressed in prensare seems to correspond to the adj. lentus, i. e. “ yielding,
“ unresisting, so as to give no firm hold or support.’'

69. Tricesima sabbata. This seems most naturally interpreted to mean “ the 30th
day of the month,” ‘ Quae Judaei Neomenias dicunt? Schol. Comp. S. S. lsai.
1. 13, 14; Psnlm Lxxxx. Dacier calculated that the Paschal festival,
reckoned from the first of September, would sall in the aoth week. Orelli
quotes Roeder’s calculation‚ that from April, the beginning of the Jewish
sacred year, to October, there would be twenty-five Sabbaths; that in the
first fourteen days of that mouth (the 7 th) there were, besides the two regular
Sabbaths, the two festivals, viz. the Feast of Trutnpcts and the Day of Atone·
ment (see S. S. N amb. xxix.) 3 and that, as these festivals are called Sabbatha,
the aoth Sabbath would fall on the ensuing festival, the lst day of the Feast
of Tabernacles (the 15th of Tisri.) Orelli adds an anonymons correction of
this process, which, by adding in the σάββατον δευτερόπρωτον (of S. Luke, VI.
1) aud the Day of Pentecost, makes the aoth Sabbath fall on the loth day of
Tisri, the Great Day of Atonement.

⁷5. Adversarius. Some have supposed this litigant to be different from the one
alluded to as vadato, in v. 36, since that suit would have been lost by default.
But it is easier to suppose one person meant; and the explanation will be,
either that the lis of v. 37 was not the full amount the defendant would lose
if nonsuited, or that, as Orelli interprete it, the plaintiff was so hot and so sels-
confident, as not to bo content without open decision in court. On this sub-
ject, Lonq’s note cm Cic. Verr. 11. 111. 15. may be consulted.. If he is right
(unless adversarius is a fr0sh litigant‚) rapit in jus, υ. 77, is an incorrect phrase,
for in judicium .- rapere in jus is properlyzad praetorem: judicium expresses
the courts of the judices, to whom the praetor remitted the case. See plaut.
Pers. IV. lx. 8,-
‘ Ago ambula in jus, leno. Quid me in jus vocas!
‘ lilim apud praetorem dicam, sed ego in jus voco.

‘ Nonne antcstaris Ρ Tuan ego causa, carnufex,
Quoiquam mortali libero aures atteram P
. ‘ Sequere hac, mea gnata, me usque ad praetorem. Sequor?
Cp. Ib. Cur-cul. V. 11. 23, sqq.

76. Antestari, “ ιο call as a witness.” If the person appealed to agreed to be·
come witness, the plaintiff touched his ear, in sign of making him such. Thus
Horace willinsrly offers his (ammonit aurem.. See in Varronianus, p. 241, the
comment on Table 1. of the XII Tablcs‚—-‘ Si iu jus vocat ni it antestator
igitur em capit0.’

78. Sic me servavit. Hom. Il. υ. 41-3,-τὸν δ’ ἐξήρπαξεν Ἀπόλλων. Some suppose
a reference to the statne of Apollo‘in the Forum Augusti,-—-‘ Forum jurisque
peritus Apollo,’ Juv. 1. 128. ‘ Sed hoc minus probabile videtui-‚² Ο.

SATIRE X.

The fourth satire, by its remarks on Lucilius, had called forth much would-
be criticism. The rivals and ‹lepreoiators of Horace had seized on what
see-med to be an opportunity os enlisting popular sympathies against him,
