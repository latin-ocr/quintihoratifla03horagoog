Nows ON THE EPISTLES= BOOK 1. EPIST. ιιι. 211'

7. In· medio positorum abstemius, i. e. “abstaining from what is within your
reachss’ In medio pos-itas is like the Greek κείμενος ἐν μέσῳ, as in Demosth. c.
Phil. 1. ’7, (p. 41)‚—ets τὸ μέσον καταθείς. Id. c. Leptinem, xnI. (p. 488) See
sat. I. 11. 108, where the same phrase is used, and in opposition to suqientia.

8. Urtica. Pers. VI. 69,-‘ Mihi festa luce coquatur Urticass See Ptin. N. H. xx ῐ.
XV. 55. (Some commentatore interpret the word of a fish, referring to v. 21 ς
but there the two dishes are contrasted‚ not, as here, classed together.

Besides, the urtica mrim was a delicacy).
ib. Ut, i. e. “ although.”

12. Cp. cic. cle Pin. V. 1111. 87. This story is told of Anaxagoras by Plutarch, in
the In'fe of Pericles.

13. Pereqre est tammus. Cp. ὁ νοῦς μὲν ἔξω, Ari-st. Ach. 398.

14. ouon tu, etc. The sense is,—“ Yon, wiser than Democritus, can amid engressing·
“ business find time and thought for lofty speculatione aud scientific inquit->¹3³

16. {1303 Ἕὸτέῖ, etc. ‘ Similes loci sunt, Viry. Geor. 11. 475, “N-3 Propert. IV. w.

18. Fumatt ,obscur-um. Virq. AEn. IV. 81‚-‘ Lumenque obscura vicissim Luna
premi .
19. Concordia discors. Cp. Ov. Met. 1. 430—433:
283:32531332531?‘13225003‘35333333053333⁸:¹0-“100’
· ‘ Cumque sit ignis aquae pugnax, vapor humidus ornnes
‘ Res creat, et discors concordia festibus apta est.'
Pope expresses the principle thus‚—‘All Nature's differ-enee keeps all
{235⁸- peace‚’ Essay on Mam, Π. 56; and less concisely in his Windsor

‘ The world harmonicusly composed :
‘ thre order in variety we see ς
‘ And where, though all things differ, all agree!

So Ben J onson, in Cgmthia’s Revel-s, Act V. Sc. 11.,—-‘ All concord’s born of
contraries ’ Burke applies it strikingly in his Prench Revolution ( p. 81, Svo.
edit.),—You had that action and counteraction, which, in the natural and in
‘ the politica] world, from the reciprocal struggle of discordant parties draws
‘ out the harmony of the universe!

20. Empedocles of Agrigentum, mc. 450. See Lucrot. 1. ¹717, sqq. His doctrine
as to the elementary forces of repulsion and attraction (νεῖκος καὶ φιλῑα) is
gliiggigxhtvtgobe alluded to in υ. 19, and his (Pythagoream) prohibitions as to

21. Seu pisces seu porrum, πλε. ‘ seu laute seu parce,’ Schol. But it means more
probably—whether you follow the Stoica or Pythagoreans. [0.] points out
that fish were a common and oheap diet in Sicily.

ib. 'fracida-³. Cp. Ov. F. 111. 34o,—-‘ Caedenda est hortis eruta cepa meis.’

22. Ultro. Some take this with petet, and the two words are osten joined. (See
Bowyer's note in Combe.) But it is better, with Obbar, to explain it‚—-“ Lct
“ your favour be so free as it seems unsolicited, promptod as much by your
“ own wish as his request.'' So Cic. ad Fam. 1111. 29‚—-‘ Omnia quse potui...
‘impetrare si petiissem, ultro te ad mo detulisse putabo, si impetravero)

2'7. Armenius cecidit. The history of these revolutione in Armenia and Parthia
may be seen in the opening chapter-s of Tacitecs’ Armals, Book 11; and in
Merivale, Vol. IV. Ch. xxxlv3 who finds an explanation of this and the next
line in the coins of this period, representing ‘ a trousered Parthian presenting
the emperor with a standard or a bow! As Ovid says,—‘ Pan-the, refers
aquilae, victos quoque porrigis arcus) Fctst. v. 5113.
