iv PREFA OE.

plaintive character of the poetry gives it a point of union with
modern feeling. .

Ι pass rather to the critical question respecting the form
and structure of his Lyrics, and Ι extract (both for its own
value,.and as my authority for printing the Odes as I do

without headings) the following passages from an essay by “

Buttmann, translated in Vol. 1. of the Philoloyical Muscam,
p. 441 :—

“ Far the largest part of the titles to Horace’s poems consist of ad,
with the name of the person to whom the poem is addrcst. This is
just our own mode, which we ascribe to the ancieutS, by which a dedi-
cation becomes an empty form, devoid of any real meaning. The
ingenious practice of the ancients, in speaking on a matter which
touched their beart nearly, was to fancy that some person, whom they
loved or esteemed, was standing by them, and to shape their thoughts
as if they were talking to him. This could not be exprest in a better
or livelier way than by a simple vocative, which they introduced in a
suitable place, but the pleasing effect of which is altogether missed, if
we have already had to read the name at full length at the head of the
poem. Lct a person for instance only read the Odes to Fuscus and to
Postumus (1. xxn. ; II. xlv.) and he will feel the truth of my assertion.

‘⁶ When Horace, in copying a pretty Greek poem, such as in Ode
1. xvnI. renders it word for word in this manner, ·

Nullam, V are, sacra vite prius severis arborem,
one clearly sees that his sole view in this address was to give his imita-
tion a livelier air; and that a title, which makes the poem look like a
poetical cpistle actually sent to Varus, and called forth by some real
occurrence, is a complete absurdity.

“ From these remarkS, it is clear in the first place, that, like every
title of whatever kind, which points out the object of a poem any
further than that object is distinctly and fully exprest in the poem
itself, every dedicatory title, which is not grounded on a vocative of
this sort, is utterly wrong, and has grown 'out of some blunder or some
arbitrary interpolation. ⁴* ⁴* ⁴* ⁴*

“ The absurdity of the present titles, taken collectively, appears
also from this,—that, while as we have just seen, the accidental occur-
rence of a vocative in an ode is made the ground sor heading it with a
name very slightly, if at all, connected with its subject ; when the poet
on the other hand couches his thoughts in such a form, that the name
he is doing honour to appears only in the third person, although the
whole ode relates to him, like that on Numida's return (Ι. xxxvl.) it

is still left without any title, as if it were on some general topic.
