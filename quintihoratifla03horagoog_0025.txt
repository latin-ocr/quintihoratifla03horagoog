Murena ’³ might perhaps be nearly as applicable to their
character. (Lect. 42.)

Of Horace's personal history and fortunes, he has left us
scattered notices. He was of a plain middle-class family at
Venusia, a military colony on the Lucanian frontier, (Sat. 11.
1. 36 ι) his father, in rank a libertinus, was by occupation a
“ coactor,” or collector of payments made for sales at auction,

intimacy of the greatest, and that on a fair and equal footing:
and, to maintain him, he received the present of a farm in the
Sabine district, about thirty-five miles north of Rome.
