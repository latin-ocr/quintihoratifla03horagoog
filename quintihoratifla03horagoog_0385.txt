30. Credula. So Milton, P. 1209. 11. 166,-‘ Draw out with credulem desii-eff·

85. Deam-0. Τὴο last syllable is elided, as in 0. 111. 1111. 35. It has been noticed
that in this aud the Brd Ode of this book there is a συνάφεια, not observed in,
the earlier books ς and that the last syllable of the short lines is not common
but long. This theory makes the elision more natural. Lachmamn (on Lacr.
xtdssllff) lays it down as a rule, ‘in quarto Gai-minum libro vocales longas non
eli ‘. ·

ΟΑΒΜ. ΙΙ.-Α1) IULUM ANToNrUM.

Iulus Antonius, son of the Triumvir and Fulvia, favour-ed and distinguished
by Augustus3 but put to death by him, s. c. 3. See Mer-ivah, Rom. Hm. vol.

llrulffs, ffian author, is supposed to have called on Horace for a Pindaric

Ode in praise of Augustus· 'Ehe poet excuses himself (as in G. Ι. VI.); but
after characterising the poetry of Pindar‚ covertly pasees on ιο sketoh the

1. Ιξιξιτῖἓὲζιῗηθεζτιθὲοπίε, “ ιο emulate Pindar is to attempt to fly like Icarus, a
‘⁶ difficult and daugerous ssight.”

3. Nititwr. Ov. Pont. ΙΙ. vn. 27‚—‘ Aves motis nitantur in aera pennis?

5. Velut amnis. This metaphor is in Pindar himself, Ol. xl. 93 and is fully drawn
out by Gray, as referred to on 0. III. 1111. 33.

ib. Imbres, etc· Hom. Il. λ. 492,—
πλῆθων πόταμος πεδίονδε κάτεισι

7. Quintil. x. 1. 61,—‘ Novem Lyricorum longe Pindarus pri'noeps, spiritus
‘ magnificentia, sententiis, figuris, beatissima rerum verborumque copia, et
⁸ velut quodam Eloquentioe flumine5 propter quae Horatius eum merito credidit
‘ nemini imitabilem!

ib. Profundo...ore. A phrase used with propriety both of a river (as in the meta-
phor) and of poets, as in Ars Poet. 323 3 Ov. Δ. Am. 1. 206.

10. Dithyrambos. The dithyramb was properly the old Bacchic song.
Διωνύσου ἄνακτος καλὸν ἐξάρξαι μέλος
οἶδα διθύραμβον. Archa. qu. 72.
Pt'md. Ol. 1111. 18,-βοηλάτᾳ ...... διθυράμβῳ.
12. Leqe sobutis, ‘⁸ irregular, rhythmica-l rather than* metrical.” In Ov. Trist. IV.
x. 24‚—‘ verba soluta modis ’ means “ prose-wdtimqss’ Cicero describes the
‘ oratio philosophorum ' as ‘ nec vincta numeris, sed soluta liberius! Orat. 60.

13. Seu. (1203, etc. Allusion is here made to the different classes of Pindar’s poems.
The διθύραμβοι are mentioned v. 10.

19. Centum potiore saynis. Cp. the opening of the fifth Nemean Ode,—
οὐκ ἀνδριαντοποιός εἶμ’
ὥστ’ ἐλινύσοντα μ’ ἐργάζεσθαι ἀγάλματ’
ἐπ’ αὑτᾶς βαθμίδος ἑσταότα.

Probably Horace means by potiore, that which will outlast statues. Pindar’s
contr-ast (l. c.) is between poen-y, actively spreading same by recitals and
publication, and statues which cannot leave (αὐτᾶς βαθμίδος, “ their actual

, , base ”) the place where they are set up.
