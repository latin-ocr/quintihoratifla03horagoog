EPISTLE 1v.—AD ALBIUM TIBULLUM.

To the poet Tibullus,—a pleasant rec-ital of the comforts and means of
happiness at his command, with a hint as to their right use. The terme and
tone of the letter, and its closing profession, are Epicurean ς perhaps affectedly
so; ‘ Ridentem dicere verum qnid vetat? ’ to prevent the hint being taken as

a reproof, or the repr-eof felt as a personality3 or possibly because the
moralist shrank from full avowal of truths but dimly seen, and the real mean·

ing of his own words.

1. Candide. So Ov. Trist. IV. Χ. 132‚—-‘ Candide lector.’
2. Pedana. At Pedum, between Tibur and Praeneste‚ was the home of Tibullus.

3. Cassi. Not the Cassius of Sat.1. x. 625 nor, though one of the conspiratom

against J. Czesar, the Cassiae, their leader.

After Brutus’ death, he followed Sextus Pompeius, and was at the sea-flght
off Mylae in 36 Β. c. Then he surrendered to and followed Antony. Eventnally
he was put to death by Octavian. Vell. Pater-culus says he was the last, as
Trebonius was the first, of the conspirators who met a violent death.

4. Ῑῖερΐανο. The same word is used to describe a student's welk, in Plin. Ep.
. an.
6. Eras, “you used not to be.” But is it not rather an instance of the imper-

fect as used (refinedly) for the present tense ?—“ Yon certainly are not, Ι
cannot think you are.’'
