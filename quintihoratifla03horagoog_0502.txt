11. &ontis mbanoe, “ of the unabashed front,'’ i. ε. effrontery. Frons is the seat of
modesty. Cp. AEsch. suppl. 198, μετωποσῶφρων. Hence the phrase sor
becoming ‘⁸ shsmeless‚” frontem peffn'care. Cp. Pers. v. 104,—‘ Per-isse frontem
de rebus! Again, as massicus is used sor “bashful '' (Cp. Cicero, Fam. V. xn. l,
¹ pudor subrusticus,’) so urbanus is ‘⁸ a man of the world‚'’ who cannot be
turned from his request.

XXIII. 11v. 3; and reprobates Bothe’s interpretation,—‘Desceudi velut in
⁸ arenam ad acquirenda praemia.) Yet this is probably the primm-y idea, from
which comes that of attempting anything which requires effert or resolution
(see on G. 111. 1. 11.)

A letter in praise of rural life = yet not so much on account of the real
beauties of scenery, as of the happiness of disposition which prefers natural
ιο artificial testes. Men's natural wants (v. 12, sqq.) ure met by the freedom,
the freshness, the landscape of the country. The love of town-luxuries is a
corruption which tacitly convicte itself (υ, 22, sqq.); which punishes itsels by
its unsatisfied longings; aud enslaves itself to habits that become a burden,
though it can no more shake them off than the horse could shake off his ridet·
when he had put himself in his power (v. 34, sqq.) Men should adapt their
wunts and wishes ιο their means and their position in life ; the discomsort of
not doing so is illustruted by comparison to shoes that do not fit the wear-er
(v. 42.) It is not the acquisition of wealth that will free us from discontent,
or discomposure 3 but a superiority ιο its attractious in the resources of our
own minds.

ὣ. Momenta, derived from moveo, must mean, ns applied to the heavenly bodies,
their “ revolutions‚” or “ periodic times ε ” here it may be construed, with some
latitudo and in connection with the next line, “ vehemence,” or ‘¹ impulse.”

22. Nempe, etc. i. e. the superiority of the country is proved by the desire rich men
have 0¹ giving s country appearance to their houses. of the desire for a
country prospect (prospicit, v. 23), Maeoenas’ house was a conspicuous in-
stance. Cp. Carm. 111. 1111. 6, sqq.
