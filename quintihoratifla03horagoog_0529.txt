EPISTOLA AD PISONEs,
SIVE

DE ARTE POETICA LIBER.

Tne title, Am· or Pom-mr, is of very early date, but creates a somewhat
improper distinction between this Poem and those which immediately precede
it. An three may be classed together as kindred in style and character, and
having a common subject. The first Epistle contains a review of the earlier
and later schools of Roman poetry, and a compar-ison of Roman and Grecian
studies in literature. The second dwells upon Horaoe’s own personal tastes
and experience, and upon the foibles and fashion prevailing with the poet-
asters of the day. The Epistle to the Pisos contains rules of composition.
These rules are so far from exhausting the general subject, that they do not
touch upon any kind of poetry except the Dramatic; and the supposition has
been favourably received, that, as far as they go, they are not so much
didactic as dissuasive; and that, whatever hints they might supply to the
public, they were primax-ily intended, by a timely raillery and a remonstrance
intelligible to those to whom it was addressed, to check their poetic vnuity,
and to divert them from attempts in which they had not genius to succeed.
Hurd divides the Poem into three parts. The first (vv. 1-89) is preparatory
to the main subject, containing general reflectione and rules.

The main-body os the Epistle (vv. 90—295) is taken up with regulations
for the Roman stage, and especially for tragedy, both as the higher species of
poetry, and, as it should seem, the less cultivated and understood. The third
part (vv. 296-476) insiste upon the necessity of correctness in language aud
st le.

may be either original or traditionary3
