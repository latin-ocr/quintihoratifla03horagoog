60 NOTES ΟΝ THE ODES ἑ BOOK 11. xix, xx.

23. See Eurip. Ion, 216,—
καὶ Βρόμιος ἄλλον
&rounam κισσίνοισι Βάκτροις
ἐναίρει ras τέκνων ὖ Βακχέυς.

28. Ἀρεύς τό μοῖραν μεταλαβὼν ἔχει τινά, Eur. Bacch. 302.

ib. Medius, ‘ cum gen? a Greek constructi0n=“ in the midst os,” ι’. e. involved in,

surmunded by. The phrase is represented in Spem-ser, F. Q. 11. 11. 4,—
‘ Far reach her mercies, aad her praises sar,
‘ As well in state os peace, as puissance in war.

'rho construction of this passage· has been obscured, and needless difficulties
raised, by taking medius as the predicate. This involves the assigning a new
and unauthoriscd sense to the word. viz. that of oque aptus. A yet greater ob-
jection seems to be, that sed is made superfluous, not to say incorrect. For
iel-em, in its semi-adverbial sense, stands properly by itself, especially if it
denotes contrariety ς though when it denotes addition, (and may be translated
‘⁸ again, besides, likewise,’') it admits et, que, even tamen, in combination with
it. In Ouia, cited at p. 4, at idem is wrong ι · Merkel correctly edits et.
Here 1 think it clear that the rendering which suits both context and usage
is this,—“ but you were the same in the midst os peace and war.''

30. Cornu. ταυροκέρων θεόν, Eur. Bacch. 100; and in v. 1017. ταῦρος, δράκων, λέων,
are all forms of Bacchus, probably (in their origin) as astronomica] signs; his
worship being constantly identified with that os the Sun. So in the Orphica,—
Ἤλιος ὃν Διόνυσον ἐπίκλησιν καλέονται. To which Thirlwall, Hist. G-reece, ch.
53, adds, in a note, that ‘ in the Indian mythology the sun has the namo of
‘ Sui-aderas, or the Wine-God.' So Herodotus (11. 42, 144,) makes Osiris, the
god os the Nile and the Eun, the same with Dionysus.
