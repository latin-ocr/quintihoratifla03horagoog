111. Milibus atque aliis, (“ happier than you) and thousands besides.’' (Orelli takes
aliis as neuter, “ in a thousand other respects.” In this case, could the snb-
stantive be understood Ρ)

112. i. e. “ Ι go where 1 w‘ill, unnoticed and at my ease 3 ask what questions, look
‘ on at what sights 1 like.‘’

113. Fallacem...vespertinum, epithets implying the place and time frequented, by
jugglers‚ hawkers, fortune-tellers (divinis), etc.

116. Lapis albus, ‘¹ a marble slab.’'

117. Echinus, probably=concha salis, as in Sat. I. 111. 14; or, as the Scholiast,--
‘ Vas aeneum in quo calices lavantur!

118. Pater-a, ‘⁴ a saucer,'’ used especially for libation, as in Vir-9. Geor. 11. 192,—
‘ Puram et sine labe salinum
(¹ Quid metuas? ) cultrixque foci secura patella.'
Cp. ‘ Salinnm patellamque deorum causa habere,’ Liv. xxm. 37.

ib. Guttus, “ a cruet ’³ with ’narrow neck, for pouring out drop by drop (yuttatim.)
Orelli cites Varro, Lat. Linq. v, 124,—‘ A guttis qustum.» sumendo simpulum
‘ nominarunt. In hujusce locum in conviviis e Graecia suecessit epichyn's et
‘ cyathu33 in sacrificiis remansit yuttus et simpulum!

120. Marsya. The statue of Marsyas in the Forum. The emblematic meaning of
his position there is given in the Bioqr. Dict. The attitude of the statue, lean-
iug forward with raised arms, is here in jest interpreted as an attitude of
defence against, or abhorrence of, Novius and his nsury.

122. Jacco, i. e. ‘ lectulus me excipit,’ Sat. I. lv. 134. ‘ Cave accipias pro dormio?
‘ Jaeere hic est perinde ac studere,' Bentl. Cp. Ε. Ι. xvu. 6; xvm. 34.

126. [susumque tn’yonem, “the game at ball.” Cp. Marem, VII. Lxxn. 93 XII.
Lxxxm. 3. Triqonem is here an adJective. The word is derived‘ from Gr. τρί-
γωνος, the players being three, and forming a triangle. (For comments on

another reading—fufio rabiosi tempora signif—and inferences as to the value
of the Horatian MSS„ see the Notos and Recursus os Orelli.)

122. Vayom aut 090...un90r. Lecto aut scripto expresses the occupatiori until about
ten, ad quartam. Then he goes out for a stroll‚ or else preparas to take part
in the games of the Campus. Compare with this whole description Cic. ad.
Fam. lx. 20,—‘ Haec est igitur nunc vita nostra: mane salutamus domi ...... ubi
‘ salutatio defluxit, litteris me involvo, aut scribo aut lege. Veniunt etiam
‘ qni me audiunt ...... Inde corpori omne tempus datur!

SATIRE v11.

This satire contains the humorous and sarcastic description of a quarrel be-
tween a rich merchant and money-lender of Clazomenas, and an officer on the
staff of Brutus, when acting as praetor in Asia. It is' said by the Scholiast,
that Rupilius had given Horace persona! provocation, by sneering at his low·
birth. Any way, both in his case and in that of his adversary, there must
have been magnum spectaculum to the poet and his friends, and a lesson to

V. 52—-69, in which the professed jester's eham-fight admits of an evident com-
parison with the real acrimony of these disputants, notwithstanding the
differ-enee of rank and station.

 

ι 1. Res Rupilias, a Roman eques, native of Praeneste, who, when proscribed by the
Triumvirs, joined the party of Brutus.
