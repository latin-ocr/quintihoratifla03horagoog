NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SATIRES .- BOOK 11. SAT. vx. 187

44. Thrw...Syro par. ‘ Gladiatorum compositiones,’ Cic. ad Fam. ΙΙ. v111.

46. Rbmosa. ‘ Patulae aures,’ Epist. 1. xv111. 70. Contr. ‘ tutis auribuS‚’ Carm. 1.
nvn. 18. Terent. Eun. Ι. 11. 23, sq„—
ἰ (gizei-353 11audivi, taceo, et contineo optime :
‘ Plenus rimarum sum, hac atque illac perfluo!

48. Noster, “our friend.” Horace adopts the familiar, half-sarcastic term used of
him by his acquaintance. γ
Ι have followed Orelli's punctuation: it makes the construction of subjectior
less irregular3 but the meaning of noster need not be affected by it.

50. myidm...mmor, i. e. “ an evil or ill-boding rumour.’' ‘ Colder news,’ as
Shakespeare has it, Rich. ΙΙΙ. Act. Π. Sc. Ν. ad fin.

55. Triquetra...tezmre, “ Sicily.” ΟΡ. Luem. 1. 718,—
‘ Insula quem (sc. Empedoclem) Triquetris terrarum gessit in oris?

ΟΡ. Ου. Fast. xv. 420‚—‘ Trinacris? A division of lande was made for the
veterane in the winter of 30 Β. c. There had been one after the Sicilian war,
which some (e. 9. Clinton, F. H. in 36 B. c.) suppose to be intended in this
passage. But see the note on v. 40, sap.

59. Per-ditur. ‘ Hoc nunc quidem unicum exemplum est praesentis passivi in verbo
perdere) [0.] Lachmann (on Lucr. 11. 829) condemns it, and correcte pov-qitzar,-
which however does not suit the context equally well. Pom-iyis horas is used
in Ov. Met. IV. 199, but in a different sense=“ you zenythen out the short
hours.'' The sense required here is not of lenqtheninq or spinninq out the clay,
but of wastinffi losinq it ,- which is just expressed by the common reading.

62. ΟΡ. ‘ Securos latices et longa oblivia potant,’ Vir-9. AE'n. VI. 714.

63. Faba Pythaqorae. See Gallim. Fr. 128, and Blomfield's note. See Luciam..
Βίων πράσις, c. 63 and Ὄνειρος, c. 4,-μήτε κυάμους ἐσθίειν, ἣδιστον ἐμοὶ ’γοῦν

ἱζοιδῇόέκτράπὲξον ἀποφαίνων...κυάμους φαγόντα, ὣς ἂν εἰ τὴν κεφαλὴν τοῦ πατρὸς
η mets.

64. ΟΡ. Juven. 11. 78,—

‘ Curius parvo qum legerat horto
‘ Ipse focis brevibus ponebat oluscula...

‘ Et natalitium cognatis ponere lar-dum?
(Bentley conjectures focis for satis in this passage.) The aspirated form
holusmla is in Hz. B. ΟΡ. J av. 11. 79, ed. Jahn. In accordance with it, I note
the var. read. holus, Ε. Ι. v. 23 xvn. 13. So, Forum Holitorium (“ the green
market ”) is the reading in Tac. Ann. ΙΙ. 49. No one, however, has aspiratcd
olitoris in Ε. Ι. xvm. 36.

71. ΟΡ. Cowper's rask .-

‘ The customary rites
‘ Of the last meal commence ς a Roman meal.

‘ Discourse ensues, not trivial, 'yet not dull,
‘ Nor such as with a frown forbids the play
‘ Of fancy, or proscribes the sound of mirth.

Δ . . ‘ Themes os a graver tone,
‘ Exciting ost our gratitudo and love.
‘ While we retrace, with memory’e pointing wand,
‘ That calls the past to our exact review,
⁸ The dangers we have 'scaped ......
‘ O evenings worthy of the gods! exclaimed

‘ The Sabine hard!
