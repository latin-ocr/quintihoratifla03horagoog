93. Meuaniae, i. s. “ with what an air of importance! ” The meaning of molimine is
explained and defined by its combination with fastus—a species of hendiadys,
which may be illustrated from Vir-9. AEn. 1. 341,—‘ Longa injuria, longae
ambages ;' or 11. 801,-⁸ Neque aurae nec sonitus memor ; ’ where the second
noun explains the first3 and 11. 896, where implet is connected with the in-
terpretative ‘ ingentem fert tumultum! Compare in Plato, Apol. 17,-εἱς
σοφίαν καὶ ἰσχύν, where the latter noun, by its dependence on the former, is
restrained to an unusual meaning, m‘z. strength os πιίηά. This principle may
perhaps be a key to Greek usage in the combination of epithets3· e. 9. iu AEsch.
Ayam. 1122, πτώσιμος may be held to deflne καιρίας in Eur. Her. F. 1274,
ἀμφίκρανον καὶ παλιμβλαστῆ, the second adj. is made intelligible by the first.
