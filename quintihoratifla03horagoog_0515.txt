EPISTLE XIX.—AD MAECENATEM.

A caustic reflection upon the fanlta of imitatem, who es osten copy the
defects as the merite of those whom they profess to admire. Some who are
authors fall into the drinking maxims of Cratinus. Others assume the gerb
of Cato, who are far from his manly force of character. Horace, now that he
hus become famous, is pentered with such blind admirere.

Far different had his own career been (v. 21, sqq.) z he had struck out for
himself a fresh untrodden track, end introduced into Italy the great models
of Grecian lyric poetry3 but dett-action pursued him, because he took no pnins
to win the popular ear or the favour of critice, and because he would not
descend to public displays in competition with any rivale.
