SATIRE V.

'l‘ms satire is ahumorous relation of a journey to Brundisium, in which
Horace had been invited ιο accompany Maecenas, who was employed on a
state embass

The poet isysaid to have had for his model a similar satire of Lucilius, frag-
ments of which are extant, the following verses among others :

‘ Verum haec ludus ibi susque omnia deque suerunt,

‘ Susque et deque fuere, inquam, omnia ludu' jocusque ;

‘ Illud opus durum, ut Setinum accessimu’ finem;

‘ Αἱγίλιποι montes, AEtnae omnes, asperi Athones.'
Το what legation and period ‘ the Journey ’ belongs, has been a vexata quoesiio.
It has been commonly referred to the convention and treaty of Β. c. 40, at
Brundisium. It has also been referred ιο Β. c. 38, when Antony came ιο Brun·
disium to meet Augustus. But it is with most reason referred ιο the peace of
Tarentum, Β. c. 37. ·

After the war of Perusia (which closed with the sack of the town, in the
beginning of the year 40, Β. C.) there was still danger indicated of an outbreak
between the triumvirs, and of another civil war. But an accommodation, in
part helped forward by the death of Fulvia, was arnived at, and the treaty of
Brundisium negotiated, by Maecenas, Pollio, and Cocceius. (See Merimle, nist.
ch. xxvu. p. 229, sqq.) The interest attaching ιο this peace, the long-ing for
it at Rome, and the joy felt when it sccmed completed by the treaty of
Misenum with S. Pompey in the next year, are supposed ιο find expression
in Virgil's Fourth Eclogue. (See Merivctle, pp. 232, 243. 8vo. ed.) Sextus,
however, unable ιο enforce his claims on Achaia, refused to fulfil bis stipula-
tionS. War again broke ont. Octavian renewed through Maecenas his
negotiations with Antony, now in Athens, who promised to act with him.
But when he appeared off Brundisium with his fieet, he was forbidden to land.
A fresh mediation was needed, and resultcd in what is called the treaty of
Tarentum, Β. ο. 37 (Me-rivale, p. 249„ when a scheme of joint action was
concerted, and a renewal of the triumvirate for five years engaged sor.

For detor-mining the date of the I ter Brundisinum, it is to be observed that
this Satire gives no assistance3 it affirms nothing beyond the importance of
the interests at stakc (v. 28); and that the mission was not the first of its
kind (v. 29,) and, incidentally, that it was undertaken in the spring of the
year. (This is inferred from the mention of the “ srogs' concert ’' in υ. 14.)
On a first view it was natural,t0 connect the occasion of it with the negotia-
tions of Β. c. 40, considet-ing the express mention of Brundisium, and the
notoriety and importance of that convention. Accordingly, many commenta-
tors (and with them E. H. B. in the recent Dactionary os Geoqraphy, art.
‘ Brundi-sium ’) assign this date to the Iter. But there is evidence, negative
and positive, to show that Horace did not enjoy the patronage of Maecenas so
early. Neyative, because, from the battle of Philippi, fought in October or
November, Β. c. 42, there could be only about fifteen months down to the
period iu question. N early a year elapsed between the first acquaintance and
the subsequent intimacy (nono mense, Sat. 1. u. 61), and so less than half a
year would be allowed sor the poet’s return with the defeated fugitives to
Rome, for his scttling there, gaining his post of employment, and a favourable
