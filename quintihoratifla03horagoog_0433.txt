NOTES ΟΝ THE SATIRES: BOOK 1. SAT. 111. 139

100. Cp. Cic. de [nuent. 1. 2,—‘ Fuit quoddam tempus cum in agris passim homiues
‘ bestiarum modo vagabantur, et sibi victu ferino vitam propagabant?
Lucret. v. '7883 923, sqq. ς Viry. AEn. vul. 316,—

‘ Gens...truncis et duro robore nuta :
‘ Quis noque mos, neque cultus erat...
...rami atque asper victu venatus alebat!

101. Ducret. v. 1282, sqq.

103. καὶ φθέγμα, καὶ ἀνεμόεν
φρόνημα, καὶ ἀστυνόμους
ὀργὰς ἐδιάξατο. Soph. Antiy. 354.

So Ο. 1. 1. 3 represents speech and language as the beginning of civilisation.
Cp. again Cic. Tusc. Qu. V. 11. 5,—‘ Ο vites Philosophia dux...tu nrbes
‘ peperisti, tu dissipatos homines in societatem vitae convocasti, tu eos inter se
‘ primo domiciliis, deinde conjugiis, cum litterarum et vocum communione

‘junxisti, tu inventrix legum, etc.'
105. So Juven. xv. 148—154.

115. Ut peccet. Peccare would be equally good Latin. After words expressing a
consequence (in arqument), a deduction‚ or a proof, either moed (infin. or
subj.) is admissible. ‘Concedis ut virtus...efficiat,·’ Cic. cle Pin. V. 26. The
two forms of phrase might be thus consti-ned ι “ Resson can never prove that
‘⁶ he is guilty '’ (peccare) ε or, ‘⁴ Reason can never so far carry its point, that he

‘⁸ will be (found) guilty '⁹ (ut peccet.)
117. Sacra...leqerit. Hence the Engl. “sacfileqess'

120. Ut serula σει-(ἴω), “ for, as to your punishing lightly what deser-ves severity, this
“ 1 do not feet-3⁹ Ordinarily, vereor ut cadas is “ 1 sear you will punish ’⁸ (the
sense required) ; vereor ne caedas, “ 1 sear you will not... ;’' but here non vercor
is, in a manner, disconnected from the first clause, which thus becomes purely
explanatory, not dependent: ‘ Ut coedas, id equidmn non vereor,’ instead of ‘ id
nefacias non vereor! A parallel anacoluthon is quoted by Orelli and by Mad·
535...ss ’ἐξ ·gg,gfiffldgssgsstfffieffssssffi Lffssss. ²3.{‚32h13¹.1¹3¹.¹321¹12⁸ {¹333} ’
“ne, rectum esset ut, si subjecisset futurum credebatur?

125. Cp. Cic. Acad. ΙΙ. XLIV. 136; aud Lucilius (quoted by the Scholiasta),-
‘ In mundo sapiens haec omnia. habebit3

‘ Formosus, dives, liber, rex, solus vocetur?

127. Chrysippus, born at Soli in Cilicia, 280 Β. c. He succeeded Cleanthes, the
successor of Zeno, in the Stoic school. He appears to have based their system
on more plausible arguments, and to have made it more known and popular,
than his predecessors. Cicero calls him ‘homo siue dubio versutus et calli-
dus’ (N. D. ΙΙΙ. lO.)‚ and ‘ in omni historia curiosus,' (Tusc. D. 1. 45.) A

Greek saying is preserved,—u' μὴ γὰρ ἦν Χρύσιππος οὐκ δν ἦν Στοά.

129. Cp. Xon Mem. ΙΙΙ. 1. 4, ὥσπερ ὁ κιθαρίζειν μαθὼν, κᾶν μὴ κιθαρίζῃ κιθαριστής ἐστι,
κ. τ. λ.

ib. Her-moyen& called in sat. Π. 72, and elsewhere, Hermoyenes Tiyezzius. The
first name implies a Greek parentage (perhaps he was a first instalment of the
supple set, ‘portio faecis Achaeae: satirised by Juvenal, 111. 61, sqq.) The
second ‚is made the ground for a conjecture that he was adopted by L.

Tigellius. See ³114). v. 3.

130. Amnius, a shoemaker of Cremona, who rose to eminence as a lawyer, at-
tained the consulship, and was buried with public honours. The word is read

here as a trisyllable‚ the e being long.

133. Vellent tibi barbam, i. e. “ mock you.'' Cp. ‘ Cynico barbam petulans Nonaria
vellat,’ Pers. Ι. 133 3 and ‘ Idcirco stolidam praebet tibi vellere barbam J uppiter,'

(ἑ. ε2.8“ Do you therefore think that Jupiter is regardless of your insults ‚⁹³⁸ I b.
