must refer to my notes for my justification. Ι feel less doubt
about C. ΙΙΙ. xxv. and no doubt at all about admitting
Lachmann's reading in C. ΙΙΙ. xxw. 4. But as the line in
its present form may appear at first sight a venturous change,
I may defend myself from the imputation of rashness here.
In fact, the change is less than it seems : Terrenum is a very
slight alteration from the Tirrenum of the MSS. (e. y. the
Harl. B. and Ε.) 3 and publicum is read both in the oldest
Blandim'an MS. and in the Harl. E. These considerations,
with the positive objections to Apulia-um given in the note, seem
to me to furnish ample ground for adopting the correction.

The kindred corruption of Apuliae, in C. ΙΙΙ. lv, 10, Ι am
obliged to leave. Yet, in the absence of any correction which
has any claim to probability, Ι venture to offer a conjecture
of my own. After inspecting all the MSS. accessible to me,
and finding no variants that could suggest a clue, I inserted
that the elements of the missing word were probably con-
tained in its corrupt substitute 3 and it occurred to me that
the error might have been introduced from the line above, by
the repetition of Ap. (just so cuilibet is introduced in one MS.
in E. I. vt. 54, for cui volet; and, in E. Ι. xlv. 21, vocas sor
putas.) The remaining letters vum (for a common spelling
is Apulliae) suggest to me a word familiar in Horace, and
possibly as a diminutive inviting abbreviation, v11.1.v1.AE.*
There is sufficient authority in the best MS. for limina ,-
besides that, the corrupt A, when introduced, would account
for the absorption of the final A, and a good sense would be
. extracted,—Altricis eoetra limina villuloe, “ beyond the pre-
“ cincts of my native homestead.''

1 hav'e very recently observed, in the Scholium of Acron,
an apparent correspondence with, and confirmation of this
conjecture. His words are,—‘ parvus extra casce limen ex-
positus!

θ As an instance of similar corruption, I may quote ¹ Vita brevem domi·
31¹1ss -εῗὲἳῗῧῑιιιῖέ sor ‘ Ulla brevem} etc, The same MS. (κ) miswrites villula
