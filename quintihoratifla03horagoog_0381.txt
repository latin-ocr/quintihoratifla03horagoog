84. Medio alveo...delabentis. For alveo Orelli reads oequore. It is very difficult to
decide which word has the best claim to be admitted into the text. The best
MSS. are quoted for alveo ‚- several have aequore, with alveo written over as a.
V. L. 3 others, alveo with aequore as a V. 1.. Orelli prefers ‹eq-nore as the more
difficult reading, involving a rarer usage, and therefore the less likely to
have been accidentally introduced, and the more likely to have been explained;
and he conceives alveo to be a gloss. To this it may be objected‚ that alveo is
not a natural gloss for oeqwore ,- it is not synonymous with it. ‘Ah-eus ' is “ the
channez or bed os the «river,'’ not the river itself. Ι can find but one passage
where alveus exchanges its proper sense of channel for that of stream, viz. in
Q. ert. V. 111. 2,——clementiore abveo .· though I allow that, in the one other
passage where the word occurs in Horace, ‘ Tusco denatat alveo,’ Ο. III. vn.
28, the two meanings are combined, and alveo becomes poetically a substitute
forfhumine or oeqnore. (We may even add Vin-9. G. 1. 203.) But, considering
the extreme rarity of this usage, it is as likely that oequore might be added as
a gloss to alveo (however incorrectly) as the contrary. Ι say incorrectly, for
1 conclude that medio alveo here means simply “ down the mid channelss’ and
admits of no such poetic enallage as ‘ Tusco alveo ’ does. Another supposition
is perhaps admissible. viz. that the poet himself hesitated between the two
words (there are two instances of such ουτω secundae in Eurip. Medea, 300 and
1314), between aequore as the more poetical, and alveo as the more correct
phrase. In Viry. AEn. ΠΗ. 86 and 96, which Orelli quotes in supportes his
reading, the context supplies a special ground for the adoption of (equor, which
would not apply here. Tiber is there represented as calming his ewelling tide,
sor AEneas’ sake, to the stillness os a lake,-—‘ In morem stagni placidaeque
paludis Sterneret aequor aquis,' and the boat glides on ‘ placido aequore! No
other substantive would so fitly express the waveless level of the stream.
