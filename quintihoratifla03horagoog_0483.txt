NOTES ΟΝ THE SATIRE'S: BOOK 11. SAT. vlt. 189

13. Doctae, i. e. “ a student.” The reading ἀπύω-ε’* a professor '' (the Schol. says
‘⁶ of oratory '') has about equal authority of MSS.

14. Vertumnis...natu.s iniquis. Cp. Sat. ΙΙ. 111. 8,-‘ Iratis natus dis ς’ Epist. H. 1.
68‚—‘ Jove aequo.’ “ Born under the evil star of all the Vertumni.” Vertum-
nus (from verto), “ the god of change.'’ ‘ Mille habet ornatus, mille decenter

habet? Tibull. IV. 11. 14. See Propere. lv. 2.

15. Scurra, ‘uz-banus} Schol. The two terms are joined in Ε. Ι. xv. 27-8: so
they are in Plaut. Prin. 1. 11. 165. Scurra is used of various classes in
Horace ς of the lowest rank of “jesters’' in S. Ι. v. 52 ; of “ a. &ner-out” in
Ε. Ι. xv, 283 of the poet’s own dependente or hangers—on in this Satire, υ. 36.
Scwrror is simply “ I play a part, or flatter,'' in Ε. Ι. xvn. 19 ; and xvln. 2.
The word is not used, but the character is described in S. Ι. IV. 87. Probably,
as it included the idea. of “ a wit‚” so it passed into the sense it bears here,

of “ a gay man, a man of pleasure, a gamester.’'

16. Qui pro se, eto. (JJ'FhC'owpevi (TaskhThe SogaJIZi-ll
‘ Bul-,⁵ ξέἑῗιᾶιῗίαζ tgecgl'l, εἷς. er carde,

17. Phintiam, “a dice-box.’' Gr. φιμός, AE'schin. p. 9, 59. Generally synonymous
with fritillas, Juv. xlv. 5 ; tunicula, Mart. XIV. XVI.

19. Levius miser, “less wretched‚’' or, “ with less sense of being so.”

20. A proverb evidently sor an inconstant charontem—“now strict, now slack ;’'
but it is a question whether it is derived primarily from the working of sail-
ropos‚ or pulleys of any kind ; or from conpling or leading animale in a stt-ing.
Ι conclude it is from the last3 comparing Pers. v. 118‚—-‘ Quae dederam supra
relego, funemque reduco ;” and 158-60.

21. Putida, “rotten,’' (see Sat. 11. 111. 75); here=“ not worth attention, tire·
some, tedious :¹² as putidiusculi, Cic. ad Fam. vn. 5. Cp. the αἴνιγμα σημαίνεις
σαθρόν of Eur. suppl. 1064.

22. Fu=rciser=“rascal.” The saroa was a sort os por-table pillory: ire sub furcam
expresses abject slavery, v. 66.

26. Cp. Cic. Ep. 11. 7,—‘ Si ea defendes quae recta esse senties.⁹
27. Coeno. This is thought to be taken from a Gfreek proverb, ἐκτὸς πηλοῦ πόδας

ἔ ειν.
31. Αἶιαεριιε, “ you congratulate and hug yourself on not having to go out.”
33. Serum. Cp. vespm-time, sat. 11. IV. 17. Epist. Ι. v. 3,—‘ Supremo sole ’ ......

ib. lamina prima. Epist. 11. 11. 98. περ1 λύχνων aeds, Herod. v11. 215. So Juven.
x. 339,—‘ante lucernas! Cp. ad lumina (“by eandle—light‚”) Vir-9. AEn. v111.

411.

. 34. Nemon, etc.

‘ Verumne Ρ itane? ocius adsit
‘ Huc aliquis! Nemon Ρ Turgescit vitrea. bilis? Pers. 111. 7.

ib. Oleum, i. e. “ oil ” for lights to light you on your way.

35. flagrisque, “you hux-ry off.'’ So in Luciam, Gallus, 9,-κᾶπειδή ποτε ὁ καιρὸς
ἄφίκετο πρὸς τάχος ἐμαυτὸν ἅπορῥῐψας ὁτι-ἔρχομαι.

37. Dixerit ille, sc. Mulvius. ‘⁴ He will say, perhaps, in justification, I am a mere
“ diuet-out, an idler, a tavern-haunter; but so are you, though you dress up
“your testes in a specious gath, and pretend to be a friend, not a parasite.”

39. Si quid vis, adde. A Cioemnian phrase ε see Ep. ad Ate. VII. 11. 3.

42. Quid si. Davus here resumes his own part.

43. Qainqentis ...... ἀναεὶιτηίε, about 5320, reckoning the drachma at 92d. Tho price
of a page (paen) in Epist. 11. 11. 5, is three times the sum.
