230 NOTES ΟΝ THE EPISTLES.- BOOK 11. EPIST. 11.

EPISTLE 11.-AD JULIUM FLORUM.

'l'ms Epistle turns mainly on the poet’s own literar-y habits, his pur-suit and
subsequent neglect of poeti-y. He puts s case (vv. 1—20,) and tells sn
anecdote (vu. 25—40,) in aelf-defence 3 sketches his education and adventures
(41—52,) and plesds decay of toste and activity. Then he enlm-ges upon the
hindrances to stndy, the calls cs society, the din os towns. Poets require
(v. 81, sqq.) a world to themselves, and even (vv. 87—101) make one, living
in mutual compiiment. With these sels-flotterers, however, he is unwilling
to be clessedz he has s higher conception cf the dignity and the powers of s.
true poet (vv. 109—125‚) and likens the scribbler's vanity to a monomsnin.
(vv. 126—140.) Finany, he declares himselss. votas-y os philosoph53 giving
up trifling or child's play (v. 142) for manlier studies, end leaving the hst-
monies cf words or music for the deeper harmony os wisdom and life (v. 143)
and so closes with meditation (v. 145, ad finem.)
