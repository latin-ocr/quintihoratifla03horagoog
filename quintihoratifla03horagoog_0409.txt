NOTES ΟΝ THE EPODES .· GARM. IV, V. 115

15. sedimusque, etc. i. e. “and he is made an Eques-'⁹ The sedilia prima were
the fourteen rows of seats behind the senators in the orchestra, assigned by L.
Rosc. Otho (Lem Roscia Theatralis, 67 Β. c.) to the Equestrian order. Hence,
‘ sedere in quatuordecim' is a phrase to express taking rank as an eques.
See Cic. ad Fam. x. 32,--‘ In quatuordecim sessum deduxit? So Szoeton. J.
Gaesar, 39. Compare the opposite phrase,—

‘ De pulvino surgat equestri,
‘Cujus res legi non sufficit! Juv. Sat. 111. 154.
Equites could not take advantage of this law without possessing the census
equestris of 400‚000 HS.

· 16. Othone contempto. There is some difficulty herc. Why is Otho said contemni,

unless (which no one supposes) this intruder broke the law? Gesner and
Bentley ingeniously explain it ‘ that he was independent of the law, having
‘ complied with its requiremcnts! But if we suppose (and it is a probable
supposition) that Otho intended to admit nouc but inqenui et cives into the
order, and that the property qualification was proposed with this view, it will
be clear that this elevation of wealthy base-born adventui-ers defeated his pur·
pose„and that they took their scats “ in despite of, or against the spirit of, his
law!

17. Ora amdam...rostrata ‘ Sine exemplo dictum videtur? [0.] Bentley ingenious-
ly conjectured aera, but unnecessarily.

19. Latroms...⁸em·zem manum. This is understood of the fleet of Sextus Pompeius,
of whom similarly Florus, IV. Vnt. 2, says,-—‘ Quam diversus a patre! Ille
⁶ Cilicas exstinxerat, hic secum piratas navales agitabat! Comp. ins. Epod. lx.
10,—‘ Servis amicus perfidis!

CARM. V.

In this Epcde is described an· assembly of Neapolitau witches, meeting for
their magical rites ε Canidia is the chief, assisted by Sagana, Veia, and‘Folia.
(They are similarly described, Sat. 1. vlu. 19—36.) Their purpose is to com-
pose a charm (amoris poculum, φίλτρον) sor Varus. (Horace represents him-
self in Epode xvn. as spell-bound by such a charm.) The principal act is the
burial of a child alive, up to the chin. (The Ode opens with an appeal to them
as they strip him, and closes with his curse.) The atrocity of offering
puerorum ecta is charged by Cicero upon Vatinius, (In Vat. 6.)

Orelli quotes, from the Latin Anthology, an epitaph upon a child supposed to
have been so sacrificed. It may be remembered that charges of the kind were
not unfrequently brought, by the malignant, against the early Christians. The
fflinor ceremonies (ιύ. 17-24.) may be compared with the witch-scenes in

acbeth.

1. At, ο deorum, A resemblance has been traced between this passage and the
speech of P. Calavius in Livy, xx111. 9. ’

5. Partubus...veris, “ if you have really borne children.'’ Cp. Epod. xvu. 50.

7. Commentators illustrate this from Quintil. Decl. 340‚—‘ Illud sacrum praetex-
‘ tarum, quo sacerdotes velantur, quo magistratus z quo infirmitatem pueritiae

‘Sssscmffiwimus ac venerabilem) So [D.] cites ‘ custos purpura' from Pers.
α . v. .

9. Noverca. Cp. Ο. 111. xxiv, 183 and Ειι-ν. Ion, 1025,-
φθονεῖν γάρ φασι μητρυιᾷς τέκνοις.

12. Insiqnibus, i. e. the toqa praeterta (or pumma, v. 7) and the bulla, worn by
children os high rank.
