1. Jum...pejerati‚ “ perjuryss’ the converse of jus-mum, “ an cath.” In these
two phrases the pt. in -dus accords with the idea of something to be maintained ι

ὓ the past part. is required to express the breach of it: pejmandi would be im·
proper to signify “ that which has been broken.” For the sentiment, Cp. Ου.

Et (sc. tamen) facies illi, quae fuit ante, manet.’

eyes! Milton, L'Alleqro, 80.

The force of the epithets serus and omenta may be illustrated from the proverb

and its explanation in S. 11. 111. 275,-“Ἰ Adde cruorem Stultitiae atque ignem
gladio scrutare)

24. Aura, a metaphor for “ influence.” Critics compare Propert. 11. xxvu. 15.
Orelli connects the term with the metaphor ‘ juvencis' (v. 21), and interprete
it according to the usage in Virq. G. 111. 251,—‘ Notas odor attulit auras? The
latitudo with which the poets used the word is evident from Viry. AEn. VI. 204,
where it is applied to εἰρὴΐρώ Auri per ramos aura refulsit?
