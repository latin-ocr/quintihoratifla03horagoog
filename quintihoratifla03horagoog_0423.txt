Q. HORATI FLACCI SATIRAE.
LIBER PRIMUS.

--

SATIRE 1.

The general subject is Oovetousness, which (it is implied) orig-instes in
Discontent, and issues commonly in Avarico. These two principles or passione
are treated of in order.

The question is proposed, and examples given, with a test (vv. 15-19) of
the sincerity of grumblers. Then (vv. 28, 29), as to the hardships which are ,
endured, they are so (at least professedly) in the hope of an eventual pro-
vision and repose. Not so with the miser. His toil has no end in prospect,
and no present fruit (vv. 38—91.) The necessity for a truer principle of life
is infert-ed (v. 92); its foundation in right reason asserted (vv. 106—7.)
But the majority of men push on with the restless competition of a race (vv.

113-116.) Therefore it is that they cannot look back to life with satisfaction,
nor to death with equanimity (vv. 117—119.)

1-3. Ut nemo...vivat, laudet...? i. e. ‘ut nemo vivat (quisque) landet! Though
the first clause contains the negative form of expression, the affirmative notion
only is to be supplied ιο the second. So below, υ. 109,—-‘ Nemo se probet ac
potius landet.' 'rho construction may be found sometimes in English ; but it
is due rather ιο accident than idiom, where it occurs. Sydney Smith (Meo-az
Phil. Lect. x1.) says,—-‘ No one would laugh to soe a little child fall, and would
‘be shocked ιο see such an accident happen to an old man, or his father!
Elmsley has a note on it; see soph. OEd. Tyr. 241, where the sentence begins

with ἀπαυδῶ, aud is continued with κελεύω understood? Cicero has a noted ,

instance of this usage, de Orat. 111. 14,—‘ Nemo extulit ....... (“ no one extols a.
speaker sor speaking intelligibly to his audience,”) sed contempsit,' etc. (“ bnt
all despise one who cannot do so.’') Also, pro Rosc. Com. 2,-‘ Adversaris. in

Judicium protulit nemo ; codicem protulit! Cp. Liv. xxV1. 2,—‘ Ut nemo ......
essent! So γίνῃ. AEn. ι. 674,-

‘ Ne quo se numine mutet,
‘ Sed magno AEneae mecum teneatur amore,' (i. e. ‘ ut teneatur.’)

2. Ratio decim-it ..sors obJ'ecev-it. The correspondence os dederit with ratio (πλε.
“ Provide-nce, or design,'’) and of objecerit with fors (tle. ‘⁴ accident, or chanco,’')
is ιο be marked ε the first phrase may be held to represent the Stoic
theory, and the second the Epicurean theory of the government of the world.

4. Mer-catores, “ tradem, ship·owners.’' ‘dve‘pn ἆλφησταί. Hom.
