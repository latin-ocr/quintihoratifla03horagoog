20 ’ NOTES ΟΝ THE ODES: BOOK Ι. xv.

10. Μουοε. Movere is “ to set in motion, to give occasion for, to begin.”· Ου. fast.
lv. 820,—‘ inde movetur opus! Id. 1. 19,—‘ pagina...movetur.'

ib. Quanta moves. Op. Eur. Hec. 629, εᾳ.,-ἒμοὶ χρῆν συμφοράν, κ. τ. λ.
11. AEyida. Garm. 111.111. 57. See Hom. Il. ε. '7383 and Eur. Ion, 996.

13. Cp. Hom. Il. γ. 54‚— .

οὐκ ἄν τοι χραίσμῃ κίθαρις τά τε δῶρ’ Ἀφροδίτης
ἥτε κόμη τό τε εἶδος ὅτ’ ἐν κονίῃσι μιγείης.

15. Οαντὴὺηα divides, τῖε. accompany your barp with singing. The dative seminis is
thought by many to be governed by divides as well as by μνοίας and the
phrase is compared with Carm. Ι. xxxin. 6,—‘ dividit oscula,-' i.e. gives now
to one, now to another. *But it seems preferable to understand the verb in a
strictly musical sense; and so our old English authors, by their imitatione,
evidently understood it. So Spenser, F. Qu. Ι. v. 17,—

‘ And all the while most heavenly melody

‘ About the bed sweet music did divide:
Again (with more precision of phrase) ,--

...... ‘ Sweet music did divide

‘ Her looser notes with Lydian harmony.'
Milton, Ode o‘n tho Pession, st. 1, has,—

‘ My muse with angele did divide to sing ς’
where perhaps the word means simply took part.

The noun division is used in shakespeare (Rom. and Juz. Act, ιη. Sc. 1.) as a
purely musical term, for “ singing many notes on one syllable3 a kind of
warbling.'' (See the note in Knight’s or in Malone's edition.) Orelli's note
is,—‘ Cantus vocalis et citharae soni inter se conjuncti totam efficiunt
‘symphoniam; jam singulatim spectatis his partibus, ἀοιδήν dividit cithara
‘camma ἀοιδή citharae sonos ,- ix. altera utra dimidia totius symphoniae pars
‘ est! “

18. Celerem. This epithet suits Ajax Oileus, not Telamonius. Ηοηὲ. Π. β. 527.

20. Pulvere collines. Hom. Il. π. 795,-μιάνθησαν δὲ ἔθειραι αἵματι καὶ κονίῃσι. Cp.
Vir'y. AEn. ιη. 99‚—-‘foedare in pulvere crines ;' and Pina, Nem. ι. 68.

22. Genti. This construction may be allowed as a Graecism ; but 1 remark that,

in all Orelli‘s citatione, except the first and two last from Tacitum also in v. ll,
there is a verb to govern. .

'Phe best of Orelli’s MSS, B, 8, Τ, c, read yentis. Bentley’s β, κ, and ΗΖ. Α.
qenti ,- and excidium, for exit-ium.

ib. RespiciS. Cf. Viry. AEn. vul. 697‚—-‘ Necdum etiam geminos a tergo respicit
angues! This usage of respicio is strikingly poetic : it acmrds, however, with
the ordinary Greek usage of ὀπίσω, to denote future time.

24. Teucer et. Ι have followed orelli’s reading. There is sair authority for te, if it

had not the appearance of being a correction. Bentley's reading, Tenem-quo
et, is still more open to this objection; yet it corresponds closely with Germ.
1V. xiv. 45, though he does not allege the passage in support of it.

ib.,8thenelus. Hom. Π. β. 5643 ε. 108.

ib. Sciens puynoe. μάχης εὖ εἰδότε πάσης, Hom. Π. ε. 549.
27. Nosces. So Hom. I l. σ. 270,-εὗ νύ τις αὐτὸν γνώσεται.

ib. Fun-it te reperire. Cp. Hom. 11. γ. 449,—

Ἀτρείδης δ’ ἀν’ ὅμιλον ἐφοίτα, θηρὶ ἐοικώς,
εἴ που ἐσαθρήσειεν Ἀλέξανδρον θεοειδέα.
27. Atros. ἄγριος αἷχμήτης. Hom. Il. ζ. 97.
