186 NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ΒΑΤΙΙίΕδε BOOK ΙΙ. SAT. Π.

10-13. Urnam arqenti...Hereule. Copied by Pers. Sat. 11. 11. Mercury ‘ praeerat
apertis lucris, Hercules opertis! Orelli. Hercule. There was an old Italian
divinity, Heroulus=“ God of the Farmyard or Fold,” from hev-cere, “ to fenoe
off‚’' whose attributes and name the Romans confused with those of the
Greek Hercules. (See Mr. Mam-iott’s Αάεῖῳὴί, 6993 and his reference to
Mommsen, R. Hist. p. 174.) The wealthy Romans offered tithes to him.
Torrentius cites Macrob. 111. 12,—‘ Testatur etiam Varro majores solitos
‘decimam Herculi vovere, nec decem dies intermittam quin pellucet-ent,
⁸ populumque asymbolum cum corona laurea dimitterent cubitum! Cp. Plaut.
Stich. Ι. 111. 80‚-‘ Uti decumam partem Herculi polluceam.’

13. Gratum. Is this nominative or accusative ἲ neuter or masculine? The best
critica decide for the first. ⁴ Ita juvat ut gratum sit animo meo,’ Orelli. So
Lambinus. ‘ Grato acceptum,’ Baster, Bothe, Grmwvius. But Doering inter-
prets ⁸ grati animi hominem ;' ι’. e. ‘⁴ if I can enjoy and be thankful sor what
I have.'’ This would accord with Ε. Ι. x1. 23.

16. Montes et arcem. Hendiadys, “ my mountain home.”

19. Autmnnus, the unhealthy season. Juv. x. 221,—‘ Quot Themison aegros
autumno occiderit uno!

20. June. For a like use of the vocative, cp. Tibulz. I. vn. 53‚—‘ Sic venias
hodierne! Theocr. xvn. 66,— ὄλβιε κῶρε γένοιο.

ib. Audis. As Gr. ἀκούειςεαρρεῖῖανὶε. So Milton, P. L. 111. 7‚—‘ Or hearest thou
rather pure ethereal stream Ρ·

23. Roma, “ when at Rome.’'
25. Erum, from brevissima (sc. dice.)
26. Inter-iore...9yro‚ “ an inner or contraoted circle.''

ib. Trahit, “ draws on slowly,” expresses the gradual as well as the late dawning·
of winter days. Others take it as contrahit, Engl. “ draws in ;” ‘ minus
accurate,' Orelli.

27. Quod mi obsit..., “ stipulatione which may bring me into trouble.'’ Cic. dc Off. 1.
14‚—‘ Qui gratificantur cuipiam, quod obsit illi, cui prodesse velle videantur!
There is perhaps an allusion here to the apophthegm os one of the Seven
Sages, ἐγγύῃ πάρα δ’ ἄτη, quoted among others in Plato, Charm. p. 165, s. 27.
(We may compare also S. S. Prov. Π. 1.)

29. Improbus uryet, i. e. “he abusos me without measure.’' If this is the right
punctuation, cp. Ε. Ι. vn. 63‚—‘ negat improbus ;' E. Ι. x. 40 ; and S. 1. lx. 73.
Compare the adverbial use, as it may be called, of plurimus, in γῆς. Geor. 1.
187 3 AEn. 1. 419. (See further in the ‘note on E. Ι. x. 40.)

30. Tu pulses. ‘ Comice de se loquitur 2da persona,’ Gesner. Orelli assigns the
sentence to the improbus.

32. Hoc, “ this,’' i. e. the sense of my intimacy with Maecenas.
ib. Melzi (dat. of mel), “is delicious to me.’'

ib. Atm...Esqu2·1-ias, “the yloomy Esquiline.” See the description os it as a
common burial-ground, in Sat. Ι. v111. 10—16.

35. ἶίἔὲηαιῗςωαε, i. e. as a witness. Cic. pro Quint. 6‚—‘ Ad tabulam Sestium sibi

38. Siqua. The signet of Augustus, and the right of using it in his name, was en·
trusted to Maecenas, with the prefecture of Italy, in Β. c. 31.

40. Septimus octa-vo, These markings os time soem inconsistent with the dates
proposed by Bentley. The mention os the signet (υ. 38) and the Dacian war,
or the rumours of it, (υ. 53ς cp. Cum. ΙΙΙ. vt. 14) appear to determine tho
composition of this Satire to the year 30 n. c., or the close of 31 Β. c. If so,
the first introduction of the poet to his patron (see Sat. 1. vx. 61) was in 39,
or the beginning of 38 13.0. This will agree with the date 37 13.C. for the
journey to Brundisium. There is a mar-king os time in Sat. 11. 111. 185, where
reference is made to Agrippa's oedileship in 33 Β. υ.
