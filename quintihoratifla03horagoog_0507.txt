EPISTLE XV.—AD NUMONIUM VALAM.

A rambling letter of inquit-y, whether Velia or Salernum has the most
attractione as a watering-place. Mention has been made before of winter
visits to the seuside (Epist. vu. 11,) and Baiae was the most sashionable
resort, but was now, by advice of Musa, aud after adoption of the “ water-cure,''
to be given up. The character of Maenius is described (ru. 26—41) as
exemplifying (though upon a lower level of lise, and by a somcwhat com-se
parallel) the writer’s own power of contenting himself with a frugal, but of
relishing a sumptuous fare.

1. Qum sit, etc. The governing clause is in υ. 25.

ib. Velia, on the coast of Lucania, founded by the fugitive Phocmans. The Greek
name is Ὑέλη, Herod. 1. 167. Another form is Elea, famous in philosophy sor
the Eleatie school of Parmenides and Zen0.

ib. Vala. It is conjectured that he may bo the same with γαῖα Numenius, licu-
tenant of VaruS, who, in the great defeat of A. Ι). 9, ‘rode off with his
⁸ squadrons, in the vain hope of escaping, by thus abandoning his comrades‚’
(Creusy’s Battles, p. 194.) The date os this Epistle is set at nc. 23, when
Musa’s reputation was at its acme. vala, if the above conjecturo is well
founded, must have been very young then, and= as is implietl in υ. 46, wealthy.
