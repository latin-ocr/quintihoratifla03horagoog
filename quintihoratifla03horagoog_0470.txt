176 ν NOTES ΟΝ Tm: SATIRES: Boot( 11. SAT. 111.

161. cardiacus. See above, υ. 28. ‘In cor trajecto...dolore.’ Wine was pre-
scribed for this complaint; hence the point of Juvenal’s satire (v. 32),—
‘ Car-diaco numquam cyathum missurus amico)

ib. Craterum. Craterus was a fashionable physician,—a Greek.

166. ἔῗιῖιέεί Anticyram. Cp. Arist. Vesp. usa—(pavlus ἀρχή, 1486) ...... rw·
ε opor.

168. S. Oppidius. Unknown.

169. Antiquo censa. Bither, “ rich in an ancient patrimony‚” or “ according to the
ancient standard ;” as Carm. II. xv. 13.

171. Nuces. Cp. Persius' allusion to these, as used by children, S. 1. 10,-‘ Nucibus
facimus quincumque relictis)

172. tudere. Bentley has perdere, a conjectura] reading unauthorised by MSS.
He brings forward, however, a remarkable array of passages, implying an
almost proverbial use of dare or donare et perdere. So Martial, IV. lin,—
‘Jam donare potes, jam perdere.’ Cp. VI. xxx. Senec. de Renes. vx. 4,—
‘ Perdere se credit, non donare.' Tacit. H. 1. 30‚-‘ Luxuria specie liberalitatis
‘imponit ε perdere iste sciet, non donare!

173. Tristem. This adj. seems to form a kind of antithesis with ludere, and so to
confirm the common reading.

178. Et natura coercet, i. e. “ and which naturally is enough.” Cp. Livy’s descrip-

tion gf tzmzerapce (in Hannibal, 111. 4),-‘ Desiderio naturali non voluptate
mo us ni us.

179. t'l'itlilllet. Cp. Cic. de Off. ΙΙ. xvux. 9,-‘ Multitudinis levitatem* 'voluptate quasi
1ti antium.' .

180. Uter. This word is not often found except in a dependent or interrogative
construction. There are instances however: see Plaut. Stich. V. tv. 51,—
‘neuter utri invidet3’ and Cic. de Off. 111. 23‚-‘ sibine uter rapiat?' and
Verr. II 111. 14‚-· si uter velit!

181. Intestabilis. Cp. Sall. Juy. 67.—‘1mpr0bus intestabilisque! It properly
expresses a legal, civil, and penul disqualificatiou for giving evidence and
making wills (in both senses of testor.)

The harshness of the verse will be sostened, if we suppose the in to bave

beepoge'ad as separable in scansion from its compound. (See Mauro on Lucr.
11. .

182. In cit-ere atquefaba. For the cnstliness of high office at Rome, see the nrt.
‘AEdiles,' in Dect. Antiq‹1.‚· aud cp. Cic. de Off. Π. 16. The distribution of
“vetchcs,” etc. to the scrambling multitude (see Pers. v. 177,—Cicer inqere
larqe Rimanti populo) is sarcastically taken to represent the expenses
generally.

183. Latus, “showily, proudly;” whether the reference be to the breadth and
fulness of the mese, aa in Ep. lv. 83 or as having the way cleared for him by
his lictors ; (so Lambinus.) Bentley compares ‘ subnixis alis me inferam, atque
amicibor 91‹›riose,·' and ‘ansatus ambulot' in mant. Pers. II. V. 63 but still
better, Cicero's expression in Aemi.. 11. 41‚-‘ Erigimur‚ latiores fieri videmur ς’
(if the reading there was not doubtful. Baiter reads altiores.)

ib. In Circo. 'Phe games in the Circus (Circenses) commenced with a showy
procession, in which persons of distinction took part.

ib. Stes. Cp. ‘ Levi de marmore tota...stabis,’ Virq. Ecl. vn. 31.

life in the Bioyr. Dict.

187. What follows is founded upon the Ajax of Sophocles; in which (from υ.
1047) the question of the hero’s burial is contested.

188. Rea· svm. ⁶ Hoc volo, sic jubeo, sit pro ratione voluntas? Jnv. Π. 223.
