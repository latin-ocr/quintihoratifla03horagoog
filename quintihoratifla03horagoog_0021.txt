6. Α Bernese MS. same date 3 c.

7. Of the MSS. collated by Bentley, the most valued is
one of the Xth Century‚ preserved at Queen’s College,
Oxford, and lettered κ. I have, by the kind permis-
sion of the Provost, cursorily examined it, and noted
many readings, Ι have also collated, and hope to do so more
fully, the best of the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum.
The oldest (Hc. A.) appears to me more trustworthy in the
general text, as it is certainly more accurate in the transcrib- ·
ing, than the Queen's College MS. I should imagine it to
be older, but both are referred to the Xth Century.

The list and lettering of these MSS. (after Combe) is as
follows :—

Ι have gleaned some information from them, and have
found my orthography justified by them. They authorise
umerus (though not umor,) erus, eriliS, harena, totiena, quo-
tiem, honustus (a reading of importance in Sat. Ι. Vl. 96)
honus, haut, habrotonum, hiemps, Hiber, Hiberico, Euhoe,
tmpto, neyleyo, belua, Iuppiter. .

Ι differ inthis from them, that they are not uniform iu
, their mode, which I conceive myself bound to be. ’

1 have haeitated to adopt the form st for est, when preceded
by a syllable capable of efisionflt· Wagner (Ortkoyraphia,

θ 'rhat the e of est should be capable of elision, and be elided in preser- .

enee to a long vowel'preceding, is analogous to the Greek usage : that it
should follow m, as in durum-st, is curione, as a conti-ast to tho principle
of the now accepted spelling hiemps, sumpsi, etc. in which the labial (again
after a Greek anabgy, e. ῃ. in βλῶσκω, βροτός, ἤμβροτον) is required as a
fulcrum between tho same two consonante.
