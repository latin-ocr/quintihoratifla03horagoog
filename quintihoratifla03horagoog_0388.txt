57. Ut ilex. Pindar, Pyth. tv. 264, speaks of the nobles of the state, under the
metapher of the branchos of the oak. The whole passage was perhaps in
Horace’s thoughts. Cp. the Boat·song in Scott’s Ludy os the Lake, 11. 19,—

‘ Ours is no sapling .........
‘ Meet-ed in the rifted rock,
‘ Proof to the tempest‘s shock,
‘ Fit-mer he roots him the ruder it blow.'
Compare Liv. vt. 1,—‘ Velut ab stirpibus laetius feraciusque renatas urbis ς’

authority. And in confirmation of his reading, he quotes eries from Tertullian
—a strange author to refer to in such a question. Bentley reads promit and
qen-it. But the change of tense is not harsher than in E. I. x. *ML—vehit
followed by serviet ; or in Juv. ΧΠ. 296,—‘ cadit ...... premetur ς’ and it may
probably be accounted for by observing that merses expresses a single im-
mediate action ; luctare, a progressive continuous conflict: to the former a
present answers, as a future to the latter. (Transiet appears to be used hy
Tibuzl. Ι. lv. 27.) 'I'o the objection that &vetuit is rarely used, or less properly
than erit, in the sense required, it may be replied, first, that Horace is noted
sor recurring to the primax-y radical meaning of words ς seeondly, that in one
sense at least of eree, evenio is its exact synonym. Compare ‘ exit locus ’ in
viv-9. AEn. v, 492, or ‘sors exitura’ in C. 11. 111. 37, with the common phrase
‘provincia evenit,’ Livy, nvn. 22, 36.
