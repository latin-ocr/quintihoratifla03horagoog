10. Anciliorum, the sacred shields of Numa. See Ov. Fast. 111. 373—8. Probably
derived (as 1s there supposed) from coedo, so as to mean a shield‘ ‘cut away all
round.’ ’l and d are not unfrequently interchanged ιιι the formation of words,
as e. 9. in oleo, compared with odom- sedeo, sella.

This passage is imitated by mmm‚1v.11,—‘Qui (i. e. M. Antony) patrias,
‘nominis, togae, fascium oblitus, totus in Cleopatram ut mente, ita animo
‘ cultuque desciverat?

15. Exemplo trahentis, “drawing from (or, more exactly, by) ‘precedent’ '(whioh the
senate would set, sinon periret, &o.“) assui-auce of ruin for future generations.n
Trahenti ιε only a conjecture.

17. Pom-et. On the lengthening of the last syllable, see ‘note at Ο. 11. X111. 16.

Per-&rent has been suggested as a correction, but seems to be (see Orelli) ·

against the genius of the language 3 unless, as Bentley further suggests, we
also read immiserabiles as a plur. nom. with pubes in apposition. Pet-ires is pro-
posed by Lachmann, on Ιηισν. 1. 11.

42. Capitis minor, “ one who had lost his rights as a oitizen.” See Art. ‘ caput,’ in
