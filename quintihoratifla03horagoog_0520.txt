51. Leviter merare vectetur, “ praised as he is, he cares little whether liis works sus·
“ tain his character ς’ i. e. he is a careless composer.

52. Somnia Pyth. Ennius dreamed that the soul os Homer had (according to the
Pythagorean doctrine os transmigration) passed into him. So Pers. vs. 10,—

‘ Cor jubet hoc Enni postquam destertuit οῦκ,
(i. e. ‘⁸ lest offdreaming that he was,” etc.)
⁸ Maeonides, Quintus pavone ex Pythagoreo-⁹

56 Doeti...alti, “ one has repnte for learning, one for losty thought.” So Quintilian,
X. ι. 97,-⁴ Virium Accio plus tribuitur, Pacuvium videri doctiorem...volunt.’
Persius, ῐ. 76, mentions these two with the satiric epitheta of venem and
ier-racem. Ovid calls Accius ‘ animosique Accius oris,' Am. Ι. xV. 193 and ”

‘atroxss Tri-st. 11. 359. (Docti, alti, have been interpreted cf Sophocles and
Euripides, oddly enough.)

58. Proper-are. Cp. Ars P. 148,— ‘Semper ad eventum festinat! It is thought to
express a liveliness of plot and style, by which the interest is kept up
throughout.

Orelli doubts is there could have been any other point of compat-ison or
resemblance between these two poete. Plautus no doubt took, as his avowed
models, the writers os the New Comedy; see his proleque to the Astomi-ia,—
‘Demcphilus scripsit, Maccius vortit barbare ς ’ and his Proloyue to the
Mwnmus‚—‘ Philemo scripsit‚' etc. Compare the (spurious) Pron. Bacchides,
Casina, 32· and Terence's Proloyue to the Adelphi.

But the general character of the New Comedy was perhaps traceable and
traced to Epicharmus. The cast of his satire, unlike the Aristophanic, was
moral, social, non ·political, often mythologioal: it was also noted sor the in-
troduction o’f a new character, regularly adopted in the Latin dramm—the
Parasite. It· is a suggestive fact, that the rise of the Latin drama followed
hard upon the first acquaintance os the Romans with Sicily. The plot os the
Mmaechmei (Prot. v. 12‚) sicilicissitat: Ennius wrote a poem entitled
hiemo-mm .- from these indicatione we may infer in what direction this
early Roman literature was drawn; aud the judgment of the critice here
referred to by Horace may mean simply that Epicharmus first (to nee
Dunlop' s words, History os R. nimature, vol. 1. p. 66)‘ composed dramas on

‘that regular, elaborate plan, which was reckoned worthy of imitation by
‘.'Plautus

ib. Epicharmus of Cos, born a. c 540, died 4502 he resided in Sicily, at Megara,
and, after the destruction of that city, at Syracuse, in the courts of Gelon and
Hiero. Eis pla s are supposed to have combined the character os the old
Megarian come y (see Arist. Vesp. 57, sqq.) with gnomio and philosophical

discourses.
