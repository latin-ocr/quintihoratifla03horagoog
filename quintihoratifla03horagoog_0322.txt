80 NOTES ΟΝ THE ODES .· BOOK Ι. xxvln.

This Ode has been thought to be a dialogue between the shade os Archytas
and a. sailor, who, finding the philosopher’s corpse ou the shore, after ship-
wreck, commiserates him (down to ver. 16, or ver. 20‚) and is then implored
to bury him. But this supposition involves a forced sense for ‘ cohibent} if
used of a body exposed on the strand; and accords ill with ‘ me quoque’ in ver.
21 ι it leaves too a contradiction between υ. 3, which affirms burial, and vo. 23,
sq. which entreat for it.

The explanation which clears up most difficulties, and which seems to find
most favour now, is the one given in Orelli’ s excursus, as suggested to him
from two independent sources. It is as follows :—The tomb of Archytas is
supposed (an inference from vv. 1—6) to be a conspicuous object on the
Apulian shore. A passing mariner (naum, v. 23) surveying it, gives vent to
reflectione upon death, and the contrast between the body‘ laid ιιι its narrow
cell: and the mind once soaring in knowledge and in thought to the loftiest
height. These reflections are contained in the first twenty verses. They are
interrupted or succeeded by an address from another speaker, whose corpse
after shipwreck has been thrown up upon the coast, and who implores buriaJ.

2. Cohibent. Compare generally Shakesp. Hen. IV. Act v, Sc. 4:
‘ When that this body did contain a spirit,
⁸ A kingdom for it was too small a bound.
‘But now, two paces of the vilest earth
‘ Is room enough?

With ‘ cohibent‚' as a proper term to express the effect of death, compare
· Ο. ΙΙ. xx. ὃς and 111. lv. 80; and ‘ coercet,’ Ο. 11. xV111. 38; and the Homeric
’ἔξω κατέσχε, Od. λ. 5485 and γῆ φυσίζοος ἦτε κατὰ κρατερόν περ ἑρῦκει,Π. φ.

the sentiment, and the following instances, Hom. Il. σ. 117,-
