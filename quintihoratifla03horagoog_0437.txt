NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΕ SATIRES: BOOK Ι. SAT. lv. 1113

87. Adsperqere. Cp. ‘ lingua adspergere,’ Cic. cul Her. lv. So below, S. I. vu. 32,
pedum. Cp. ‘ dicteria dicis in omnes,’ Mart. VI. κων.

90. 'Ignis character of a ‘niqer answers nearly to Canning's ‘ Candid inend,’ in the
nti-Jacobin .-
‘ Candour, which spa-res its foes, nor e’er descende
‘With bigot zeal to combat sor its friends :
‘ Candour, which loves in see-saw stt-ain to tell
⁸ Of acting foolishly, but meaning well t
‘ Too nice to praise by wholesale, or to blame,
‘ Convinced that all men's motives are the same 3
‘ And finds, with keen discriminating sight,
‘ Black’s not so blank, nor white so very white.

‘ Save me,- oh save me, from the Candid ‘Friendfl
94. Petilli. Cp. Sat. Ι. x. 26. He was said to have stolen the crown from the
statue of Jupiter in the Capitol, and to have boen acquitted only through the

influence of Augustae. Hence the name Capitolinus. This was, however, a
regular surname of the qens Petillia.

100. Hic niqroe, etc. i. e. “ this is the blackness (see υ. 85, and v. 91) you condemn ς
“this is sheer malignity.'' (Yon profess friendship‚ yet insinuato crimes
against your friend. Sincerity would repel them as slander3 you admit
covertly their truth.)

101—104. AE'rt190, “copper rust ;'' hence, metaphorically, that which eats away
(rodit, v. 82) a friend's character. So Martial applies it,——‘ viridi tinctos seru·
gine versus,' X. xxxnI. 5. AE‘ruqo is used by Juv. 1111. 61, contemptuously,
sor σεε, as we use “ dross ;” and this sense would not be inapplicable here, as:
“ a valueless profession, a base counterfeit, of friendship.''

102. Ut si, sc. ut promittam siquid possam promittere...

104. Hoc...juris. Cp. ‘hoc via juris habet,’ Ου. Nam, 134; and ‘juris idem,' Π).
138. So ‘ officii...ide1n,' Fast. 1. 46. Cp. Liv. lx. 19,—-‘§hoc enim roboris erat!

105. Insuez=it,..hoc me, ‘¹ he trained me to this (i. e. to free speech and raillery)
‘⁴ while he marked out, in particular exemplos, existing vices, that 1 might be
‘⁸ deterred from them.’' Comp. Ter. Adelph. Act 111. Sc. 111. 60,—
‘ Nil praetermitto, consuefacio, denique
‘ Inspicere tanquam in speculum vitas omnium
‘ J ube0, atque ex aliis sumere exemplum sibi?

106. E-remplis. ‘ Quoniam ratione non poterat, v. 115, ες] [0.]

109. Ut male vivcdz“ how wretchedly off he is!’' Cp. Ε. I· XVII· 10· The
opposite oi bene, not of reate vivere. Bene esse, or m'vere, mostly signifies “ enjoy-
ment,’‘ S. II. 11. 12ος Ε. I. VI. 56; recte vivere, “rectitude,” as in E. I. ΧΠ.
17. So it is opposed to suaviter, in E. 1. vm. 4. So below, υ. 134, rectius
differs from melius.

115· Sapiens, “a philosopher.” His exposition of causas is in contrast with
exemplis, v. 106.

123. Judicibus selectis. See the art. ‘Judez’ in the Dtct. os Antiqq. p. 532. ‘ Praetores

...jurati debent optimum quemque in selectos J'udices referre.’ Cic. pro

126. Amans, ‘ intemperantes ;' v. Schoz.

127. Εέιὲιίιηαί. A frequent word with Cicero. So the subst. exanimatio, de Off.
1. .

128. Teucros, i. e. not yet hardened by vice.
131. Et istinc, even from those which you imputo to me.

133. Lectulus. Cp. jaceo, S. 1. vx. 122, with note; and Bentley's quotation of Pliny,
Ep. v. 5,—· J acere in lectulo sno compositus in habitum studentis, habere ante
se scrinium ita ut solebat)
