EPISTLE xxm—AD QUINCTIUM.

A description of the Sabine sarm (vv. 1—16.) The moralist then posses on
to the sources of enjoyment,-—resl enjoyment, as distinguished from the show
of it, which relies on public opinion. This false show, the desire of standing
well with the public, is further trsccd and analysed in its love of flattery, its
acceptance of prsise not justly its due (vv. 25—31.) If it is pleaded thet this
is a. natural liking (v. 32,) it must then be shown to be a. weak and foolish
one (vv. 33—38.) He whose honour depends not on his own sterling merit,
but the publio gift, subjects himself to mortification whenever that gist- is
reclaimed3 hc who is pleased wit-h flattery, will be hurt by obloquy. The
worthlessness of such a character is then shown, and the confusion cxisting
in many minds between the love of goodnoss in itself, and the abstinence,
which circumstances enforce, from wickedncss (νυ. 40-60.) Men of principle
feel that they have a post of honour to defend ; men of the contrary stamp
ure renegedes (v. 67,) fit only for menn and slevish employments. The free
and fem-less independence of the good is illustrated, from the dialogue of the
tyrant Pentheus and his supposed prisoner, in the Bacchae os Euripides.
