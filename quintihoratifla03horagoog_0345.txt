the more plausible it seems. Apart from the metrical question, there is an
evident awkwardness in combining the two adverbs, ultra, aliunde, without a
{ggjunpgp'} Τὶὲῗιειΐέγὲιιᾱ position of ve would be the same as in S. 11. 111.

17. saqittas. ‘ Vere sublimi imagine eundem Israelitarum timorem a pharetratis
Assyriis expressit Jeremias v. 16,-'s φαρέτρα αὐτῶν ὡς τάφος ἀνεῳγμένος.”
[0.] Saqittas et suqam. Virq. Geory. 111. 31,—·Fidentemque fuga Parthum
versisque sagittis! So Milton, P. Καρ. 111. 323,—

‘ How quick they wheeled, and, flying, behind them shot
‘ Sharp sleot of arrowy showers against the face
⁴ of their pursuers, and overeame by night!

19. Robur, the dungeon of death at Rome ; Isto. xxxvm. 59,—‘1n robore et tenebris
exspiret? The earliest prison at Rome was the Carcer- of Ancus Martius, Juv.
Sat. 111. 314, to which was added afterwards the Tullianum of Servius.

21. Furvae, an old word, used especially as an epithet of the regions of death. Cp.
Ov. Met. v. 541. Said to be akin to ‘fuscus ' and ‘uro,' and therefore to
signify burnt brmvn, dasky. But Mddezz and Scott’s Lex. seems to connect it

with ὄρφνδς and ἐρέφω.
23. Discretas. See Epod. xvx. 63. Cp. Virq. AEn. vm. 670, -—‘ secretosque pios.'

21.AE01iis. Sappho and Alcaeus were the two great leaders of the AEolian school
of lyric poetry. Sappho calls her house μοιζσόπολον οἰκίανε it is conjectured
that she was the eentre of a literary society, in which she may have had rivals.
Gorgo and Andromeda are mentioned as ἀντίτεχνοι. (The imputatione brought
against her by the comio poets (Cp. Ου. Ep. xv.) and sometimes implied in
the explanatione of this passage, are resuted by Welcker3 and see Muller's
In‘terature os (ἕνεκα.) They were contemporary with Pittacus, who held his
power as αι’συμνῆτηε, 588-579 ao. Alcaeus’ share in the hardships of the
civil war is alluded to vv. 27, 28.

26. Cp. Ov. Ep. xv. 30 ς Α. Α. 1. 206.

ib. Auroe...pzecta·o. Pina. Nem. v. 243 Eur. Herc. F. 351. Quintilian assigna
rather a fanciful emphasis to the adjective, zib. X. 1. 63.

28. Dura suqoe mla. Viry. AEn. 111. 160,—‘ Longumque sugae ne linque laborem.’

30. Mirantur is used here with acc. and infin. instead os the simple acc. So, in
Carm. ΙΙ. xx. 19, cantemus has both constructione following it.

31. Tymauos, probably the leaders of the popular party, as Myrsilus (see ‘note on
0. 1. xxxvn. 1), Megalagyrus and the Cleanactidae, by whom Alcaeus, who was
on the side of the nobles, was exiled. Pittacus also, when invested with
supreme power, was attacked by the poet in his odes. Melanchius, however,

· a former tyrant of Lesbos, is praised by him in Praqm. 21. (On the origin and
age of the word τύραννος, see the Greek argument to the OEdipus Tyrannus.)

32. Densum mnes-is, “ crowding up.’'

37. Pelozgsgoparens, Tantalus, of whose punishment see odyss. λ. 582; and Inter.
111. .

38. Labmwn decipitur, “has his sufferings beguiled.” ‘ Fallere curam, laborem,’
„is a common phrase, so ‘ decipitur labor’ might be used. This seems to be
an instance of the partitive genitive3 as the vetus Scholiastes explains it. “ He
has a part of his labours taken from him.” Key, in Lat. G-mm. 940, says,-
‘ Verbs of removal or separation have a gen. in old writers and poetry; so in
Horat. ‘ abstineto irarum, desine querellarum ;’ and (which just corresponds to
