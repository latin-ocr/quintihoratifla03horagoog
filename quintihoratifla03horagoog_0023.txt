PREFAOE. xi

The order in which the works of Horace are usually
printed, viz„ odes, EpodeS, Satires, Epistles, is apparently
different from that of their composition. Their dates, as
conjecturally assigned by Bentley, are given below3 and in
spite of the difficulty of reconciling them to particular
passages in the several books, their principle seems to be ac-
quiesced in. The question has this principal point of interest*
about it, that it bears upon Horace's character as a man and
a poet; since we find, in passing from the Epodes and Satires
to the Odes and Epistles, a higher refinement of feeling and
power of poetry ε the harsh and objectionable passages of the
first works find no place in the latter : and while the grace-
fulness of his lyrics justifies all the claims he makes as
“ Romanae fidicen lyrae,” there is no less· a grace in 'the soft -
and mellowed ease of the Epistles of his declining age.
Moreover (as is shewn in G. Stallbaum's preface to his
edition) it may be found that the historical events of the
different periods account for the bitternesses and asperities of
the earlier books, composed while he was struggling with
adversity‚ and pining under a neglect, from which his genius
soon raised him, but to which, for the time, it must have
made him the more sensitive. And the recollection of the
miset-ies arising out of the anarchy and violence of the Civil
War—“ quaeque ipse miserrima vidit, et quorum pars magna*
fuit ”—might well suggest to him the admiration for the
Emperor expressed in the joyful and adulatory language
which, however excessive to our ears, did not sound so to his
contemporaries· ’

The Epodes are alluded to (Ep. I. xlx. 23) as “ Parii
iambi.'’ This name was applied to poems in which each
second* verse was shorter than the first (as in elegiae poetry) ,
e. q. the lst Epode,—or in which one of the verses was made
up of two metres of distinct character, as in Epode 13.

The Satires are the ‘⁶‘ Graecis intactum carmen‚'' (Sat. Ι. x.
06) according to the Roman boast of Quintilian,—“ Satira
