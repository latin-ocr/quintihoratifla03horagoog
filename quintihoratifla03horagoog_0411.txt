87. Venena maynum, etc. “ The great law of Divine justice cannot influence sor·
“ceries (i. e. sorcerers) as they can men. Therefore Ι will entreat no more,
“ but exsecrate. Ι will not appeal to you as if you had natural feeling, and
‘⁴ could be sostened.’' So Orelli. But, in this construction, would not valet
be more Horatian than valent ? Will it not be better (while following Orelli
in the main points) to reverse the order, and take venena for the nom. case Ρ
Thus—‘ Sorceries (and those who use them) cannot change (i. e. turn aeide or
‘ defeat) the Divine laws, as they can men and men’s law. Therefore Ι appeal
⁴ to them ε such an appeal will draw down a wrath implecabless⁴

‘ atras Esquilias,' Sat. ΙΙ. VI. 33. (See the description in Oookesley’s Map of
Rome, and Inde-v, p. 84.)
