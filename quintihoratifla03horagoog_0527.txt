149. Monstrata, “prescribed.'' Cp. ‘monstrata piacula,’ Vir-9. AEn. w. 636. So,
‘ monstra quod bibam,’ Plaut. Men. V. 1. Compare AEsch. P. V. 490,-ἔδειξα
κράσεις ἠπίων ἀκεσμάτων (though the verb is there used properly of the dis-
covery of medicinal herbs.) '

166. Vivas numerato. Cp. Sat. 1. lv. '793 A. P. 10⁴. In these passages the idiom
differs from the English by making the verb unimportant‚ and subordinate to
the participle; vivas numerato is=numerareris. 111 A. P. 104 the literni
translation in English would not only be uuidiomatic, but contrary to the
meaning3 which is not, “ if you speak your part ill,” but, “ if tho part which
yon bave to speak is ill set.'’ This idiom is of coustant recurrencc in Greek ε
e. 9. Thuc. Ι. 20,-τύραννον ὄντα ἀποθανεῖν (i. e. “ that he was tyr-ant when he
was slain ;'’ the question was not whether he died, but whether he reigned) :
and in the same chapter, βουλόμονοι ...... δράσαντές τι καὶ κινδυνεῦσαι (where the
English idiom would put δράσαντες in the infinitive‚ as “wishing to effect.
something in their peril,’' or, ‘⁸ not to run into such peril without achieving
something.”)Cp. Xen. Cyrop. V. vu. 9,-σαφηνίσαντα καταλιπεῖν. Cp. Luciam,

the very shortest time preceding) deuotes time absolutely distinct from the

3. Olim (properly the locative of illa) “at that time, another time, some-
times,” refers to indefinitely distant time, whether past or future, aud is
opposed to nuper. Quondam (proper-lyme locative of quidam) refers only to
the past, aud is opposed to nunc. See Donamson, Lat. Gr. p. 166.
