‘NOTES ΟΝ THE EPODES: CARM. xvt. 125

x. 145. Livy (tv. 37) gives Vulturnum as the original name ς deriving Capua,
⁸ vel ab duce eorum Capye, vel...a campestri agro) Twiss’ note makes
Vulturnum the Latin equivalent of Capua, Capys being Tuscan for vultur, and
tho name being derived from some augury. If so, there is a resemblance to
the legend of Rome.

6. ‘⁴ Faithless in times of revolution.'’ The allusion is to the conduct of the
Allobroges in and after the Catilinarian conspiracy.

13. Carent, i. e. “are protected srom,'' (in their tomb.)

15. This sentence is equivocal in construction. Orelli paraphrases thus,—‘ Quid
‘ adjumento sit ad carendum laboribus! There is, perhaps, no other instance
of expedio taking this usage and syntax ς though, if we compare impedio, its
exact opposite (which admits an infinitivo, and accusative, as in Ov. eae Ροπ.
[. 1. 213 and Cic. de Orat. 1. 163,) there seems some analogy for it. [G.]
explains carere as an iufinitive, used, as in Greek, substantively; quoting ’
‘ adimam cantare,' E. ΙΙ. v. 68. Bentley approves a conJectural reading,-‘ quod

expediat,’ taken parenthetically. Others have understood it thus,——‘ Qua-ritis
c. quid expediat, aut m. p. qum-itis carere. If this were admitted, it would be
better to jein the adverb with effodiat ;=“ is you are seeking what may tend
‘⁶ to the general wolfare, or, hopeless of that, are seeking for the better part a
“refuge from calamity,” ete. But the first explanation seems the most ap-
proved. ff

ib. Forte...quaefftis‚ i. e. si sorte, answered by sit. “ If you ask...no resolve can be
‘⁴ better=let us resolve...to go.’'

ib. Quid expediat...carere, “what may help you to get free from.’'

24. Ratem occupare, i. e. “ to embark at ouce.''

when the thing would come to pass.

31. Subsident), ‘⁸ to pair with? ΟΡ. Vir-9. Ecl. v111. 27,-‘ Iungentur jam gryphes

33. Ravos. ‘ Videtur expressisse Homericum. Od. λ. 611,-χαροτοί τε λέπη-ις’. [0.]
