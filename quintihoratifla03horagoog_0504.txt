ib. Navibus atque quatlriyis, i. e. “excursione by sea and lend.'’ The naves,
“yuchts,” here spoken of would be private property. Cp. Ε. Ῑ. 1. 93. So
quadriyae were perhaps commonly used for driving or display; they are scl-
dom mentioned but with reference to the gemes, or as used in war, though
Cicero (orat. 157) speaks of postmeridianas qamt-iffae. The words auswering
most nearly to our truvelling cat-ringo seem to have been reda, and the
smaller and expeditione cisium.

EPISTLE XIL—AD ICCIUM.

A letter to Iccius, who had formerly been devoted to philosophicnl pursuits,
and iu the enjoyment os literary ease, until he gave way to a turn for specula·
tion, and emberked in the Arabian enterprise of AEl. Gallus, (Germ. Ι. xxlx.)
'rho failure of that expedition perhaps reduced him to poverty, and his
nbilities found a new direction : he became the agent for Agrippa's estates
in Sicily. He was ill at ease (v. 3) in this position. It is inserred from this
letter thet he felt and complained that this agency promised him no eventual
wealth, and yet thet it absorbed his time and energies ; that it, in fact, dis·
appointed both the objects he had formerly had in view, viz. the prosecution
of intellectual studies, and the acquisition of a wealthy independence.

Horace meets this complaint with kind and sensible reflectione, reminding
him that he has an his actual wunts supplied, that health and temperance
need nothing more, and could gain nothing more from fortune. Upon his love
for study he congratulates him, comparing him favourably with Democritus,
in being able to combine the execution of practical and necessary duties with
sublimet theories and speculative rescnrch. He goes on to request his good
offices for his friend Grosphus; perhaps desiriug for Iecius’ own sake to en-
gagc his feelings by new society, and by the opportunity of kind and useful
action. The letter ends with the last news os importance from the East.

Plutarch's Life),—
