74 NOTES ΟΝ THE ODES .· BOOK 111. x, xl.

7. Ut yluciet, i. e. “you see how the clear sky is freezing the lying suow.” [u]
quotes Soph. Ρταριη. Achill. 162,-πόγυυ φανέντος αἰθρίου. ⁸

8. Numine. Inssmuch as ‘Jupiter’ is used for ‘AEther‚' umam is drawn into
the same metaphor‚ und becomes a descriptiva term.

9. cp. sm. HippoL e; πῡιιιι. 1.v111.69.

10. the. “Lest sll should be suddenly reversed.'' The metaphor is from e rope burst-
ing back, when at full tension on a. turning wheel.
Orelli cites Aristid. Panath. p. 118,—
πάντα ὥσπερ κάλον ῥαγέντος ἐχώρησεν ὀπίσω.
(κόλου is for κάλω. Arist. was s rhetor of the 2nd cent. Am.)

14. Tinctus viola pallor. Cp. Virgil’s epithet, ‘pallentes violas: Ecl. 11. 47. Ovid
has another compet-ison for paleness, Met. lv, 134,-‘ Oraque bna-o Pallidiom
gerens: (sc. Thisbe.) Cp. ὁμοῖος θάψω (“ a dye.”) Theocr. Id. 11. 88.

15. Pia-sa, “Pieriam” ine. Macedonian. 'l'he northern Pierisns introduced end
spread the worship of the Muses in Greece, and accordingly this adjective be-
came their descriptive epithet; but in this place it has its first and proper
sense ss a geographioal term.

17. Parcae. This is usually taken ss an entreaty, and Orelli explains it thus,—
⁸ Quanquam humani nihil te flectit, tamen veluti dea miserere,’ not quite
satisfactorily. Mr. Shffleto, 1 understand, proposes to make it a dependent

verb‚—‘curvut ut percas} πλε. “induces you to listen to me ;” which makes γ

better sense, if it were preceded by quando instead of quemme.
1⁸: Cp. Ov. Ep. Χ. 1,—‘ Mitius inveni quam te genus omne ferarum!

CARM. XL—AD MERCURIUM.

8. Sappho, noym. 70‚—117‹ tra χελύνη λέγε, φωνᾶσσα δὲ γίνεο.
6. Cp. Ars Post. 4043 Hom. Odyss. ρ. 271.

9. ΟΡ. Amor. Praqm. 75,—
πῶλε Θρηκῖη τί δή με
λοξὸν ὄμμασιν βλέπουσα
νηλεῶς φεύγεις ;...
νῦν δὲ λειμῶνός τε βόσκεαι
κοῦφά τε σκιρτῶσα παίζεις.

so sur. sacch. 162— monim ae ἄρα

πῶλος ὅπως ἅμα ματέρι φορβάδι
κῶλον ἄγει ταχύπουν σκιρτήμασι βάκχα.
And v. 866,—&2 νεβρὸς χλοεραῖς
ἐμπαίζουσα λείμακος ἡδοναῖς.
⁰⁰mp‘ Shm’p' ffiesscffisstn‘gtgeafiffiddssgssffitssss hex-d
‘ Or rece of youthful and unhandled colts,
‘ Fetching mad bounds, &ol
...... ‘ Therefore the poets
‘ Did feign thet Orpheus drew trees, stenes, und floods!

17. This stsnzs hus been condemned us spurious by many great critice, yet itis

necessary as an explanation of the indefinite term ‘ J enitor aulae.’ (consult
Orelli's Excursus in defence of it.)

18. Ejus is e word mre in poetry, but it does not follow thet it is spurious.
Exeatque is Bentley's conjecture, ancl has hed favoni-erm but a little considers-
tion will show thet the passages udduoed in support of it (6.9. Ου. Trist. IV.
ιιι. 413 V. Π. 20, etc.) make against it. The phrase was common enough,
but only in the sense of “ expiring‚'’ not of “ breathing.”
