PREFA GE. Δ vii

But the tracing out my idea suggested to me another
emendation, which, but for this Scholium, Ι should think more
probable. Which is the right reading, altricis or nutricis?
Editors prefer the former word 3 MS. authority clearly favours
the latter. The ”two are nearly synonymouS, but nutricis
rather indicates a personal than a local name, as the ·proper
word to stand in apposition to it. A slighter change than

that proposed above supplies one. The addition osone letter, ·

or even the change of a to c, will give vtmcn=vlmcAE z (ac-
cording to the common MS. writing of e for ce.) The vilica
was an important person in a plain country home, the re-
sponsible manager for every part of the household arrange-
ments 3 (Venit in locum matronae, says Columella, who has
a long description of her duties, lib. ΧΠ. ab inxit.) On the
supposition that the poet was motherless, who would have
been more likely to have the ordinary charge of him ’.Ρ If
these deductions are admissible, the reading of the text
should be thus,—‘ Nutricis extra limina vilicae)

Ι find the phrase extra limen used in a somewhat analogous
way by Pliny, (Ep. 111.-111.) used of sending a boy from
home pupilage to a preceptor out of doors,-Studia extra
limen proferenda sunt.

There are several minor corrections, which Ι need not
, notice here. The Various Readings, given below the text, are
selected partly for their MS. authority, or their acceptance
in past editions, or their intrinsic claims to attention.

In the matter of general Orthography, Ι assent to modern
usage, and the principles stated by Mr. Munro in his preface
to Lucretius3 for I confess to a prejudice in favour of uni-
formity and correctness. Yet I have also a considerable
sympathy for ‘ mampsimus,' and Ι am half inclined to rest
on the example and authority of Augustus, and to retain the
double l in millia. Spelling no doubt has its right and wrong,
as well as other things3 nor are the questions it raises
unimportant for precision in learning, or for directing attan.
