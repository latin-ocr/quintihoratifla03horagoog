xiv PREFAOE. ⁹

attached friend ε and where can we find a truer affection than
that brenthed in the first Epode‚ and the Ode ΙΙ. xvn. ? To
which we may add, the pleasure with which he dwells 0180-
where 011 his friend's recovery, and the popular acclamation
to him (as in Od. Ι. xx.) 3 while with it we instinctively con-
nect the remembrance, that the promise of the Ode was truly
spoken, and that the last journey was trodden by the patron
and the poet in the same year.

His· figure, as well as his temper (to the quickness of which
he elsewhere alludes, as in Od. III. xtv. 27) he has
described in Ep. I. xx. .

The anticipation there expressed, that among the signs of
approval of his works ,would be that of their adoption as a ’
text-book in 80110018, is confirmed by Juvenal (Sat. vn. 226.)
Persius, his admirer and imitator, has charact-erised his
genius in well-known lines, Sat. 1. 115 :—

Omne vafer vitium ridenti Flaccus amico

Tangit, et admissus circum praecordia ludit,
Callidus excusso populum suspendere misc.

In modern times there may be found a singular testimonial
to him, and one which curiously indicates the universal
classic taste. It is in “ Walton's Life of Hooker,’' where he
mentions that Edwin Sandys and George Cranmer, taking a
journey to see Hooker‚ “ found him with a book in his hand
(it was the Odes of Horace,) he being then, like humble and
innocent Abel, tending his small allotment of sheep in a
common field.”
