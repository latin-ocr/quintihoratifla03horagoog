32. AEmilinm...lndv‚zm‚ said by the Scholiast to be an old gladiatorisl school of
AEmilius Lepidus. It stood in the Forum Romanum.

ib. Un us. See Bentley’s noi-e for provinz}⁸ and illustrating this reading. The word

50. Cim-tutis, i. e. ancient ς who wore the rude undress of former times: “ bare-
armed.’' Lucan has in the same sense ‘ erserti Cethegi‚’—(Phars. 11. 543.)
The word is only found here and in Or. Fast. v. 101, os the Luperci, who
stripped themselves to the mere cinctus, a band over the loins.

the metaph0r‚ and introducing a tautology.

60. Hom. Il. ζ.146,-οἵη περ φύλλων ’γενεὴ τοιήδε καὶ ἀνδρῶν.
Cp. Viry. AEn. vl. 309,—
‘Quam mults in silvis autumni frigore primo

ib. Recepteae...Neptu1nu.3‚ i.e. the formation of the Portus Julius. This was done
Β. c. 37, by connecting the Lucrinus lacus with the Avernus, and making a cut
for ships through part of the seaward bank of the Lucrine, 'while the rest of
the bar was strengthened. The work is described in Viry. Gom-9. 11. 161,—
...... ‘·Portus Lucrinoque addita claustra,
⁸ J ulis. qus ponto longe sonet unda refuso,
‘ Tyrrhenusque fretis immittitur aest-us Avernis.'

65—68. Sterilisve...iter melius. What works are here meant? The Scholiasts
say, a ‹irainage‚ first, of the Pomptino Marsh ; secondly, of the swumps of the
Velabrum. Of the first alleged work there is no record. Orelli under-stands
the second ‘ de cursu Tiberis aggeribus correcto ; ’ after, possibly, the inunda-
tion mentioned Carm. 1. 11. But if mersum mutarit could be applied to such a
work, iniquusfiuqibns seems a strange epithet for a flood which cume ‘ de·
‘jectum monumenta Regis Templaque Vestfe? May not tho fact be, that tlw
I'urlus Julius alone was eoluplctcd—thc othei· two works merely projvcwd?
