be confounded with the learned Varro Reatinus. He was born Β. c. 82.
Quintil. x. 1, says,—‘ Atacinus Varro in iis per quae nomen adeptus est inter-

Sat.11.1.63-;) and such he was, both as to the form and the subject matter

of his Satires. Those of Ennius had been composed in every kind of metre,

and were wholly irregular· ‚ and m their subject they were principally a ‹le-

lineation of daily life: but Lucilius wrote only in hexameter verse, and

apparently (like Horace and Juvenal) dealt with peculiarities of character,

with vices, and with persons. (Some editors have interpreted auctor of
Eunius5 but there are great objections to this.)

‘ Quid, di crudeleS, nisi quo nova funera cernam,

' ‘ Vivacem differtis anum Ρ· (“ Why do you lengthen out her life ?'')
