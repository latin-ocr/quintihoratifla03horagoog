CARM. xxm—AD POPULUM ROMANUM.

This is one of the most remarkable of all Horace's poems, both in its
political and its poetic character. Politically considered, the sentimenta os
'despair and the proposal of abandoning Italy are foreign (as Walckenaer re·
marks, rol. 1. p. 82, lim. 11. 16) to the true Roman temper, and imply an ex-
tinction of the old republican spirit. A proposal‚ indeed, os thev kind had
found supportem after the defeat at Cannae ; but it was checked at once (Liv.
xxn. 53), and punished afterwards by the Censor (Liv. xxn'. 18.) These
sentimenta contrast strongly with those of other odes3 e. 9. C. ΙΙΙ. 111. in
which, after eulogies on an undaunted and constant mind, the poet is thought
to be protesting against any translation of the imperial power of Rome; or
those in which one ruler and one restorer of law and order is recognised,
honoured, and trusted3 as in Ο. Ι. 11. 25, sqq.; Ο. ΙΙΙ. 1v. 37, sqq.; III. xxlv.
2'7. In this Epode the appeal lies to the community and the general opinion
(vv. 15, 39.) And this view of the poem falls in with the very early date
assigned to it,-—a date when the poet was at the lowest ebb os his fortunes,
and saw nothing but despair3 or, is he had just begun to recover himself, and
congratulate himself on his personal escape and his return to Rome, he might
shudder at a fresh outbreakfif war, and the possible reversal of all hopes of
public or private welfare. Walckenaer infers an early date for the poem, from
the character of the poetry. He finds indications of a youthful nnpractised
author in the extent of details, the length and luxus-ianoe of description. He
allows, however, that ‘ le yrand. pob‘te- s'y nwnt‘re tout entier) The metre chosen,
a combination of hexameter and pure senarian iambic, has a stately harmony‚
suited to grave, earnest thoughts, and passing no less easily into a flow of

happy aspirations. ‘ Cette ode dut plaire a ces ames genereuses et douces qui,
‘ dans les maux de leur patrie, ne trouvent de distractions a leur tristesse que

‘ dans les reves de la poesie et dans les fantaisies de l’imagination.' There is
a fine paraphrase and application of the latter part of this Epode in the Rev·
Isaac Williams’ Christian Scholar.

1. Altera...aetas‚ “a second generation.” Altera jam aetas inde a Sulla! [O.]

2.·Suis...viribus. ‘ Hoc est quod Titus Livius ait (in his, Preface), ‘nt magnitu-
dine laboret sua-⁸ V. Schol. This phrase means more than swa magnitudine,
especially if compared with υ. 9 : it is equivalent to the line, C. 111. vm. 19,—
‘Infestus sibi luctuosis dissidet armis.² [O.] quotes Manil. 1. 9103 xv. 43.
