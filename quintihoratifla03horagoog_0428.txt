134 NOTES ΟΝ THE SATIRES .· BOOK 1. SAT. 11.

SATIRE II.

A satire upon those who run into one extreme to avoid another, as expressed
in v. 24,—-‘ Dum vitant stulti vitia, in contraria currunt! There is the indis·
criminate liberality, out of which strollers and quacks make their harvest (vv.
1-4) ε opposed to this is the par-simon that will refuse help even to a starving
friend (vv. 4—6) ε a third (home, υ. ζ) lavishes his fortune upon luxui-iona
entertainments. Fufidius (vv. 12—22) is an usur-er, extreme in his exactione and
his wealth, and no less so in the penury of his living. So, in matters os dress
or foppery, nil medinm est, υ. 28. The rest of the Satine is taken up with
scandalous anecdote ; so as to involve the moral, however, that lawless habits
omni parte laborent (υ. 39.)

1. Ambubaiarum, “Syrien musicians” (cp. Juv. 111. 62), named from their

by the ιιι. Tables was a, yearly one, uncini-ium smuszone—twelsth os the suem
horrowed, or 8} per cent. But, in later times, interest was paid every mouth,
and, in calculating it, the rate was expressed by the as and its divisione. Thus,
asses usuroe signified 12 per cent„ being 1 as per month: deuncos usuroe=ll
per oont.: uncias usurae (uncia being the 12th of an as) signified 1 per oent.
Instead of asses usura, the phrase centesima» usura! was osten used, because at
this rate, in 100 months a sum equal to the princ-{pal was paid up. And thus

bina· centesimoe usurae was 24 per cent. ς and in this passage quinas is equiva-
lent to quinas centesimum, or 60 per cent.

16. Nomina, i. e. “ bonde, or bins-’³
18. At in so...“ but of course he spends liberally in proportion...Not so,’' etc.

20. Telrenti {thsslmt The Heautontimorumenos. Cp. Act ΙΙΙ. Sc. 1. 31, with v. 24,
‘ wm vi n ,’ erc.

25. Maltinus. This is a name derived from malta, a Lucilian term for an
effeminate person. The Scholiasts affirm that under this name Maecenas is
intended, and that these tunicoe ἀρηιίεείυὶω, which were generally a sign of a
foppish and luxurious habit, were adopted by him to hide varicoso veins.
Kirohner (Quaest. Hor. 111.) adopts this statement of the Scholiasta, and infers
from it that this Satire must have beon composed some time before the poet
had become known to his patron. Orelli quotes Madvig as decisive against it ς
but Franke and Weber as, amongst others, supporting it. (See the Philo-
loqical Muscam, vol. 1. pp. 47·1-9.)

36. Albi, i. e. ‘ matronae veste alba indutae,’ [O.]
59. Trahit-:his reputation suffers moro than his estate.

62. leirzvare. Prop. limo obruere, as in Γέτῃ. Geor. 111. 136, ‘suloos oblimet
mer es.

63. Τομέα, a term of reproach. The toqa was worn by low chamcters: the proper
dress of a lady was stola.
