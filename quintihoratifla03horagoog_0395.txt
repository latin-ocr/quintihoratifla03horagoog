GARM. XII.—A.D VIRGILIUM·

Aa Virqibiwm. 'I'he general authority of oritics is against identifying⁴this
Virgil with the poet. Bentley, indeed, in spite of vhie own chronology for this
Book of Odes (which he dates ae Β. ο. 17—15, eine. three or five years efter
Virgil’s death), seems to take the identification for granted. Mitecherlich and
Dillenburger affirm it, and so does the Baron Walckeneer (livr. 111. 26), who
argues thet v. 25, studium lucri, accords with the character of virgil, as in·
dicated by the property and weelth he left behind him ; and that the title ‘ ad
Virgilium negotiatorem,’ found in some MSS„ might have been a jest upon
some speculatione in which et the time the poet hed engaged. This supposi-
tion, however, is open to the objection that a. neqotiator signifies more properly

. a “ banker,'’ or “ man of business,'' than one ⁸ interes& dasne quelque mtrem-ise
maritime) And upon the whole, Gesner, as quoted approvingly by Orelli, is
right in saying thet there is nothing in the Ode ‘ quod magis ad poetam quam
ad quemvis alium Horatii sodalem pertineat?

1. Quoe mare temperant. In Horace’s age, no winter voyages were attempted.
See Ο. 1. IV. 2, end 111. vn. 2.

ζέφυρος τότε θρήκηθεν ἄητον) ; the ὂρνιθΙαι, which brought the birds of passe-ge.

Columella (in Orelli, not.) says ‘ per dies triginta esse solent, tum et hirundo
