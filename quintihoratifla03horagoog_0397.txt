GARM. XIL—AJ) VIRGILIUM·

Aa Virqibiwm. The general authority of critice is against identifying'this
Vir-gil with the poet. Bentley, indeed, iu spite of his own chronology for this
Book of Odes (which he dates as Β. 0. 1'7—15, i.e. three or five years after
Virgil’s death), seems to take the identification for granted. Mitscherlich aud
Dillenburger affirm it, and so does the Baton Walckenaer (livr. 111. 26), who
argues that v. 25, studium lucri, accords with the character of Vix-gil, as in·
dicated by the property and wealth he left behind him; and that the title ⁸ ad
Virgilium negotiatorem‚' found in some MSS„ might have been a jest upon
some speculatione in which at the time the poet had engaged. This supposi-
tion, however, is open to the objection thet a. ‘neqotiator significa more properly

. a ‘⁶ banker‚” or “ man of business‚” than one ‘ interesse? dans quelque eampo-ise
„nav-etima? And upon the whole, Gesner, as quoted approvingly by Orelli, is
right in saying that there is nothing in the Ode ‘ quod magis ad poetam quam
ad quemvis alium Horatii sodalem pertineat!
