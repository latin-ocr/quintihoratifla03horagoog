xii PREFAOE.

tota nostra est,” (X. 1. 93), a kind of poetry first struck out
by Ennius (“ Ennius noster,” Cic. pro Arch. vm. 10.), fol-
lowed, at some interval, and with a difference in the treat-
ment of the subject, by Lucilius, The name is derived from
“ satur,'' the miscellaneous character of the subjects being
compared to the “ satura lanx‚'’ i. e. the dish of various fruits
offered as a sacrifice, or firstfruits 5 and then coming to signify
any “hash '’ or “ olio-'³ So Juvenal describes his work as a
“farrago‚” and “quidquid agunt homines” as its legitimate
materials to work up. ⁸

The Odes, on' the contrary, are formed on the Greek type,
and some, no doubt, directly adapted from Greek originale,

keeping even the Greek names; From them it is we derive ,

precision,—a merit in which he may be contrasted with
Ovid, wh0, however remarkable for the variety of cadence
and rhythm in his verse, is far inferior to the Greek elegiasts.
The restriction‚ uo doubt suited to the genius of the Latin

the flexibility and ease, and much of the grace, of his models.
We have a few lyric odes from CatuHus3 but whether they
had less circulation, or were less formally published in books,
they are not considered to interfere, by their simple priority
of time, with Horace's claim of being the first introducer into
Italy of the AEolian strains.

The Epistles are probably, of all Horace's works, the most
admired 3 and they are those which seem to place us most at
home with the author, and to give the most pleasing reflex of
his character. Otherwise, they may be elassed generally with
his Satires, as a sort of continuation of them, but with the
sostened and easy style betokening inward satisfaction, pros-
