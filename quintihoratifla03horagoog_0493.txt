70. Quod si, etc. It is altogether in the style of Horace, to soften the didactic
character wherever he assumes it, to preclude giving offence in giving advice ς

EPISTLE 111.-AD J ULIUM FLORUM.

A letter to Julius Florus, to inquire after old friends associated with him in
attendance upon Tiberius, who then bad a command in the East3 written
also to encourage him in liter-ary and intellectual studies ; but mainly, perhaps,
to draw him to a complete reconciliation with a common friend, Munatius.

1. Of Julius Florus nothing is certainly known. Walckenaer conjectures that ho
may have been a younger son of Aquilius Florus, slain with his eldest son in the
proscription. Torrentius infers from the praenomen that he was a provincial,
enfranchised, and adopted into the Julia. qens. A Julius Florus is mentioned
by Quintilian, as distinguished for his eloquence ; and by Tacitus, as fomenting
a rebellion among the Treviri, A. 1). 21 : Tac. Ann. 111. ιι..

2. Claudius, Tiberius Claudius Nero, afterwards the Emperor Tiberius. He was
sent, Β. c. 20, to the East, to place Tigranes on the throne of Armenia.

3. Thraca, a form used also by Vir-9. AEn. 111. 335.

4. Turres, ‘ Seston et Abydon,' schol. The mention of these countries is adapted
in its order to the route of Tiberius.

9. Ιπ ἕνα. As vio-9. G. 111. 9‚—‘ per ora ς’ and Theoqnis, 240,-·ιι·ολλῶν κείμενος ἐν

10. Pindarici, etc. i. e. an imitator of Pindar. Comp. Garm. IV. 11.
11. This is perhaps an imitation of Callimachus, Epiqr. xxm. 4.
