114 NOTES ΟΝ THE EPODES: CARM. tv.

CARM. IV.

An invective against some unknown person, raised unworthily to office.
(Compare Catull.1,11) This person has been commonly identified with
Pomp. Menas (mentioned ln the note on Carm. 111. xvt. 16), who 88181108*-
ever, an officer os the navy, not of the army, 88 is implied in v. 20· ε others give
him the name of Vedius Rufus. Orelli quotes two inscriptions from the
copies :—

(1.)‘ Ad Sextum Menam Pompeii libertum.’

(2.)‘Vedium Rufum ex servitute miratur usurpasse equestrem dignitatem
usque ad tribunatum militarem!
(On this subject see Class. Muscam, vol. 11. p. 208. Mr. Dyer holds that Menae
is the person attacked, and argues from Dio, vanI. 25, that he did hold
military as well 88 naval commende.)

1. Lupis et eqni-3. Hom. Il. χ. 293 ; Aristoph. Pax, 10753 Ov. Ibis, 43.
ib. Sortito obtiqit. This phrase is from Plantae, Mero. Ι. 11. 25.

3. Ilbertt’cignsunibus), “ made of the spartum, or Spanish broom.’' (Comp. Quintil.
‘ns . . ΤΗΙ. 11.

8. Bis trium ulnarum toya, i. e. 8 showy sumptuous dress, 88 ‘amplissime veste '
(worn by the muti-ons in their rejoicing), Liv. xxvu. 52. Ε contra. ‘urta
togu,’ Epist. I. xvnl. 30.

The Scholiast quotes Cicero’ s sure-ustie description, ‘velis amietos non togis?
Gatiz.11.10,which corresponds to Juvenal's (Χ. 39)* aulaea togae! Bis ter is
found‘ in several MSS. but it is bad Latin, and seems but 8 copyist’ s explana-

tion of the figure 111. or the abbreviated form bis t. Trium is 8 correction
generally adopted.

9. This may, perhaps, be properly translated thee, —‘ ‘See how 8 free (ι’. e. unre-
served, undisg'uised) scorn alters the countenence of 811 who pass elongl’
All commentatore, however, appear to construe ora 88 οουῑοες vertat 88 synony-
mous with either convertat or av ertoet, (i. e. seorn draws 811 eyes on you, or
turns them away). But no one has 8ᾱᾶιιοοᾶ any instance of verto, when uu-
oompounded and without n preposition, bearing this meaning.

11. Cp. Anacreon, Fr. 19,—

πολλὰ μὲν ἐν δουρὶ τιθεὶς αὐχένα πολλὰ δ’ ἐν τροχφ,
πολλὰ δὲ νῶτον σκυτίνῃ μάστιγι θωμιχθεὶς,

νῦν δ’ ἐπιβαίνει σατινέων (Cp. v. 14.) ·

ib. wama—ratibus. The fflmnviri Capitules (‘ vindices rerum capitalium,' Sall.
Cat. 55) were charged with the execution of the penal senlences of tho law.
This invective may in 8 general way be compared with that of Juvenal against
the elevation and insolence of the slave,—

‘ Vcrna Canopi...
‘ Nuper in hanc urbem pedibus qui venerat albis! Sat. Ι. xxvl. 111.

12. Proeccmis. It seems to have been the office of the proeco to proclaim the
grounds of the punishment during its infliction. J avenul's expression (though
not to be confounded in meaning) may be compared,—-‘ Hebetes lasso lictore
secures! Sat. vm. 136.
