45—4-8. M. Claud. Marcellus. Viry. AEn. Vl. 856. Five times consul, victorious at
Nola, conqueror of Syracuse: ‘⁸ His fame (crescit) is sustained still ;” an
especial compliment to tho young Marcellus, husband of Julia (see the well-
known AEn. w. 870, 884) to whom by some the phrase Julium sidus is thought
to refer, on account of his marriage -with J ulia. Others refer it to the whole
qens Iulia, but most to Julius Coesar. Perhaps the phrase was chosen as
designedly equivocal, and capable of various or wider application. It is
observed by Orelli, how rarely there is mention in Horace or virgil of Julius
Caesar, as if such mention might give umbrage to Augustus.

47. Sidus. This maybe merely a metaphor, ss in Ouid, Trist. 11. 167,-‘ Sidus
juvenile, nepotes ;' and again, Pont. ΙΙΙ. ιιι. 27,—‘O sidus Fabiae, Maxime,
gentis, sdes? But it is more probably an allusion (as in Viryil, Ecl. ιι. 47 3
AEn. vm. 6813 and Propert. IV. νι. 59) to the comet which was seen during
the gemes of Venus Genetrix, held by Augustus in commemoration of Jul.
Caesar. ‘ (Sidus crinitum por septem dies ......... conspectum .. ...significari
‘ vulgus credidit Caesaris animam inter Deorum immortalium numina receptam!
Plin. N. Η. ιι. 23; Cp. Seu-ton. J. C. 88.) Henceforth a star was set on the
forehead of Coesar’s statue in the Forum.

48. Sappho, Fraym. 3,—
ἆστέρες μὲν ἀμφὶ καλὰν σελάναν
ἂψ ἀποκρύπτοισι φαεννὸν εἶδος
