‘thue snum Bacchis non sentit saucia vulnus,
‘ Dum stupet Edonis exululata jugis;

⁸ Sic ubi mota calent viridi mea pectora thyrso,
‘ Altior humano spiritns ille malo est.’

12. Ut mihi, i.e. “ how enrapturing is the scene !'’ Orelli has taken away the stop
after Rhodopen, and makes nt dependent upon mm secus. Yet the construc-
tion, if allowed, is absolutely ἅπαξ >imbuerem no authority whatever has been
adduced sor it, and the analogies supposed to authorize it are defective. For
instance, the fact that ut as well as ac is found after perinde and pariter is not
sufficient: these words coincide nearly in meaning with non secus ,· bnt they
do not coincide in construction, sor they cannot take quam after them3 nor
could non secu-s be substituted‘ for pariter in such passages as Viry. AEn. 1. 714 3
11. 729. The proper word to compare with secus is aliter. Again, Hor. carm.
1. ΧΠ. 7-9 is quoted as (ες-υθ- ut, but the quotation is inexact, for ut follows
sic in v. 8. On the other hand, nen secus may stand by itself, with the
answering clause or participle suppressed; for it does so 0. ΙΙ. ιιι. 2.

13. Ripae. Bentley rivos. Gesner quotes Carm. IV. 11. 31, as showing that the
authentic reading is equivalent to it in meaning. Others have read rupes.
Ripae is more expressive of the poet 's wanderings.

CARM. XXVI.—-AD VENEREM.

2. Μίῖίΐαιᾶῒόεῑῑο, as in Ου. Am. Ι. 11. 1 3 and Ars Am. 11. 233‚—‘ militioe species
amor es .’

3. Nunc amna. According to the practice of a soldier (emm-itus, (ἵε.) who had
served his time. See Ov. Trist. lv. vul. 22. Cp. the gladiator in Ε. Ι. 1. 4.

ο5. Marin-oe. ‘ Venus orta mari,' Ου. Ep. xv. 203. Cp. Ov. Fast. xv, 62. Walckenaer
(lib. 111. ξ 17) affirms that, among all the appellatione of Venus,—‘ Celui de
⁶ Mat-ine sex-vait surtout ὸ, la caracteriser comme deesse de la voluptef

8. For-ibus minaces. This epithet seems to suit vectes only: the introduction
therefore of the word arcus is an instance of zeuyma. Or, the mention of

· “ doors ’' may imply that of door-keepers. Again, the bow is a weapon suited
to Cupid’s warriors. For the general idea, cp. Theocr. Id. 11. 128.

9. Ο quoe. This Ode contains a sort of satire (as does the llth Epode) on lovers'
inconsistencies. He exemplifies his own description in Sat. 11. 111. 261,—
‘ Hzeret invisis foribus,’ and Sat. 11. vn. 91,—‘ Eripe turpi colla jugo3 Liber,
liber sum dio age; Non quis; urget enim: etc.

10. Memphin carentem ......... nive, i. e. “the glowing Memphis.’' 'rho goddess is
perhaps appealed to under these titles, as able to persuade by wealth, or to
kindle by warmth.

CARM. XXVII.——AD GALATEAM.

1. Parra. This name has been variously interpreted as “ the jay,” “ the lapwinq,”
‘⁴ the woodpecker ,·'' 1 believe it is ‘⁴ the owl.’'

interpretation. His arguments are clear and probable‚ (they may be seen at
