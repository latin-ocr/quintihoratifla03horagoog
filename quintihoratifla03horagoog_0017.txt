‘⁸ No mistake however can be more unfortunate, 'than that of lookiug
on the Odes of Horace as a number of occasional poems, each of which,
at the time when it was composed, was grounded, as a matter of course,
on some real occurrence, and could not be understood, to the suu extent
of its meaning, except at the moment and by the persons concerned in
it, though Horace published it some time aster, because it flattered one
of his friends, or because it happened to be lying in his portfolio. The
only end that Horace kept constantly in view was, to give the Grecian
lya-e to Latium. With this design he took many of the best subjecta,
with which the Greek models furnished him, fitted for being treated
lyrically, and imitated those modeIS, but in a genial spirit of imitation ε
at times, as one may fairly presume of such a writer, his own imagina-
tion supplied him with like subjecta : now and then too-for who will
deny this ?—incidents in his own life, or among his friendS, afforded
him materials, which he made use of for a similar purpose.

‘¹ When, in the course of a few years, his pen had thrown off a
number of such essays, he collected a portion, though, as we know aud
see, only a small one, of his earlier and later piceas, which, by steadily
and laboriously polishing them,.he had brought near ‘to what he con-
sidered as pel-fection, and, uniting them in a book, now at length sent
them out into the world. Nobody, it is to be hopcd‚ will fancy that
each of these collectionis was conveyed by Horace with a number of
Scholiums ; or that high and low in Rome were familiarly acquainted
with all the anecdotical incidente which gave rise to each several ode 3
- or that our poet, whose grave and noble purpose we have just stated,
went about histask so negligently, as to bind up even a single flowcr
in thc posy he placed before the public, the real excellence of which
could not be fully discerned without a knowledge of such trivialities as
the Romans were no less ignorant of than we are.

‘⁴ The reader, who looks at all the allusions in Horace’s lyrical
poemS, with the exception of the patriotical oneS, from an ideal point
of vieW, will, so far at least, be sully able to relish every beauty that
they contain.''

Ι come now to the consideration of the Text adopted. In
determining it, I have relied much upon Orelli, his judg-
ment as an Editor being acknowledged, and his Swiss MSS.
being, with one exception, the most ancient and authoritative,
and for the most part Ι should feel distrust of myself in ‚dif-
fering from his decision. Still, there are not a few places in
which it may fairly be questioned. I have differed from him
with much hesitation in C. III. xxiv. 24, and xxix. 34. Ι
