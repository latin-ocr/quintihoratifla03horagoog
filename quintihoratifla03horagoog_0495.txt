EPISTLE V.—AD TORQUATUM.

This is an invitation to a holiday entertainment on the eve of Caesar’s
birthday (v. 9), in which are mingled praises of conviviality, and a refined
regard also to niceties of teste, comfort, and security.

1. Δ’ἕναζιέοκςιέτὲιιιένοοῗίο by Archias, some workman of the day. ‘ Archias breves· lectos
eci .’ c .

2. Olus omne, i. e. a frugal meal. “ A mero saled, nothing but salad.'’

3. Torquate. See Oarmfw. vn. 110 seems (see vv. 10, and 31) to have been a
lawyer. Compare the mention offacundia in the ode, v. 23, and the figurative
arbitria, as an image of death.

4. Iterum Tauro, sc. iterum consule ,- 1³. c. 26.

ib. Diffusa, sc. ‘ ex doliis in cados ' ...... ‘ Contra defunditur, Sat. 11. 11. 58, ex cratere
in pocula.’—-Orol1i. Anglice‚ “ bottled.'’

5. Petrinus, ‘ ager Sinuessae vicinus: Schol. Now the ‘ petit village de Piedimonte.’
Cicero had a villa there, ad Fam. VI. 19. [W.]

6. Arangae, ἴδε-,Γᾶ it me.” ‘Recte dici arcessere rem patet ex Cic. Ate. XVI.
ιι. .’ .

7. Splendet. 'rho brightness of the hearth, not of a fire, is intended.

9. Moschi causam. This was a well-known rhetor of Pergamus. Walcltn. suggests
that he had, perhaps, given Iessons ιο Torquatus. He was tried on a charge
os poisoning, and was defended by Torquatus and Asinius Pollio.

ib. Nato Ooesare. Augustus’ birthday fell on Sept. 233 and [O.] understands
this of that day ε ‘ Sic nude dictum vix aliter intelligi potest‚’ and ‘ snb caelo
‘ Italico illa quoque nox quae proprie erat autumnalis, dici poterat motiva!
The difficulty regards rather the time of year, than the term adopted: oestas
and oestivm might very well be extended to September, one would suppose:
but such passages as Ε. Ι. vn. 5, and xvl. 16; and Juv. vt. 517‚—‘ Metuiqne
jubet Septembris et Austri adventum‚' imply that the sear of melaria would
have driven all the fashionable world away, and left very little society in
Rome. Therefore others interpret Coesare of the Dictator, whose birthday,
the 12th of July, was registered as a public holiday.

16. Desiynat, i. e. ‘ plan, sketch out.' So ‘ qnae designata sint et facta,’ Plane. Most.
11. 1. 66. And in another sense, ‘ modo quid designavit P’ (ι’. e. ‘¹ what new
prank has he playedi’ '') Ter. Aa. Ι. 11. 7.
