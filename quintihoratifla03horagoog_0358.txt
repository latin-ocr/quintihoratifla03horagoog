31-68. Suetonius, Jul. Coes. 79, mentions, as one of the reports of the time, that

51. Hmncmos iu umes. Is this accusative to be joined with coyere or with rapiente Ρ
[0.] takes it with the latter, for the sake of the opposition‚ ‘inter humanos
usus et sacrum quod cum deorum sit exemptum est usui humano! In that
case, humanus (which is properly the opposite of divinus or coelestis) will be put
for profanus ,- thus oreating a difficulty, slight perhaps, yet requiring some
exemplos or explanation to be adduoed. 1 think that to punctuate astoer usu-s
(as Gesner does) suits the order of words better; also that rapere is more
properly constructed by itself. The whole verse (52) is simply=sacrileqa
manu, as Ο. ΙΙ. 1111. 2. [0.] quotes Plaut. Τι-ἰπ. 1V. Π. 36‚—‘ Rapere
properant qua snorum qus publicum ς’ which is a good example of the inde·

for himself, then (as joined with consilium, v. 41.) for the state and its great
ruler (v. 37, altum Gaesao-em), whose rightsul and secure supremnoy is com-

pared with that of J upiter.

2. Lonyum...melos may be translated “ a sustained melody,” but it is enough to
understand it (with Ο.) as a mode of saying, “ Come, and leave me not hastily
or soon.’' Does it express πολυμελὲς ἀοιδᾶς μέλος, Alcm. Fr. l Ρ Alcm. Fr. 29
