156 NOTES ΟΝ THE SATIRES: BOOK 1. ΕΔΤ. lx.

SATIRE IX.

The favour of Maecenas exposed Horace to detraction, as we see in Satires
lv. and Π. So it invited sycophancy: and here we have a lively Satire on an
intruder, forcing himself on the poet’s acquaintance. It has been thought
that Propertius was the bore thus satirised ; but there is no evidence of it:
the description has also been compared with the third character of Theo·
phi-astus, but on little grounds. See Walcketmer, vol. 1. p. 281. The Satire
was no doubt founde on fact. The character is humorously copied by
Μοῑίὸτε, in the first Scene os Les Feicheuae. Compare too Ben Jonstm, '1720
Poetaster, Act ΙΙΙ. Sc. 1. In the course of the dialogue, incidentauy, is asserted
the honourable and independent relation which existed between the poet and
his patron. There is a curicus and diffie-ult allusion to the Jews in v. 69.

4. Quid nqis? “ How are you ?’'—-the common form os salutation. Compare
E. 1. 111.15. But see a double meaning put on it in Cic. pro Plano. 14,—
‘ Quid agis, Granii’...1mo vero tn, Druse, quid< offis? a retort upon him as
‘ multa in rempublicam molienti!

ib. Dulcissimo rerum. Compare, for this phrase, Ovid, Art. Am. 1. 213; Metam.
vlu. 49; ΧΠ. 502. The Greek ἄριστα ἀνθρώπων, (i. e. ‘⁸ the best way in the
world,”) as in· Plat. Theaet. 15, is nearly the converse os it.

5. (ἐῧρίο, etlc. Cp. ‘ Omnia quae tu vis, ea cupi0,' Plaut. Pers. V. 1. 14. Id. Eud.
. 1v. .

6. Num quid vis ? A phrase of bidding “ good-bye.'’ See Plautus, Aulul. 11. 1.
533 Ter. Eun. 11. 111. 49. ·

7. Norig=“ you must know me, surely.” This is better than construing it as a
wis .
8. Misero...quaerens. So again v. 14. Cp. Ter. Andr. 111. 11. 40; Heaut. IV. 1. 36.

Compare the Greek compoumL δυσέρως; and Ov. Her. vn. 30,—‘ pejus amo.’
Compare too the Virgilian phrase, ‘ dira cupid0,’ Geor-9. r. 37 ς AEn. ιχ. 185.

11. Cerebriselicem. Comp. Sat. 1. V. 21, cerebrosus,- i.e. Bolanus would have rid
himself of the man at once, by flying into a passion. Bolanus is a cognomen
derived from Βοῖα, a town of the AEqui.

15. Jcmn dudum. Wagner writes δ)“(ιτη11ι(1κιιηι-“ Μ in compositis ante d mutatur in
‘ n.’ Or the words may be written separately. Here, S. has ,iam m’deo diadum.

16. 1 cannot think Orelli’s punctuation of this verse an improvement upon the
common text. Hinc weakens and interferes with the sense, if joined with
persequar (if he had not been persequens all along, it might have some mean·
ing.) And, unless the sentence is interrogative, nunc is out of place, and
cumque is wanted. The sentences run thus: “ Yon want to get away3 it is
“of no use5 I shall hold on, and follow you (per) to the end. Where may
“ you be going to next ?‘’ Then the next line is natural as a reply. Bentley
reads with some MSS. prosequar ‚· the differencc of meaning is worth notice,—

‘ Prosequar esset, officii causa porro sequar!
18. Cubat. Ov. Her. xx. 166.

ib. C'aesaris hortos. The gardens or pleasure grounds bequeathed (Suet. J nl. Ces.
83) by Julius Caesar to the people. They were beyond (i. e. on the right
lan't of) the Tiber.
