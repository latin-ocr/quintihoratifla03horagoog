25. Thus paraphrascd by Lord Melbonrne (see Haywarcl’s Essays),—
'Tis late and Ι must haste away,
My usual honr os rest is near :
And do you press me yet to stay ς
To stay, and revel longer here Ρ

'rhen give me back the scorn of care
Which spirits light in health allow,

And give me back the durk brown hair
Which curled upon my even brow.

And give me back the sportivejest
Which once could midnight hours beguil05

The life that bounded in my breast,
And joyous youth’s becoming smile.

And give me back the fex-vid soul
Which love enflamed with strange delight,
When erst 1 sorrowed o’er the bowl

At Chloe’ s coy und wanton ssight.

{31:¹12 ἔξω me these, and 1 will stay, —
Will stay till morn, and revel here.

strictness, make a better sense; und his conjecture is approved by Lachmann
on Imm-etan. 1015· but the old fabulists kept little to probabilities or con·
sistency in particulare, and the ἴοι was the most frequent character introduced

by them.
