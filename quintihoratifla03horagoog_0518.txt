Q. HORATI FLACGI EPISTOLARUM
LIBER SECUNDUS.

The opening nddrees is to Augustus, who is said by Suetonius to have. com·
plained that he was not mentioned in the Satires. He is classed with heroes,
benefactore of antiquity, and conti-ested with them in having his merite
rightly judged, and in receiving homage dne, even in his lise-time. This intro·
duces the proper subject os the epistle‚ in which complnint is made of the
nnreaooning eulogies passed on ancient poete, and of the neglect of oon·
temporat-y and modern authors (v. 21, sqq.) These old samarites are
enumemted, and the sashionable opinion of them severally ie cited (vv. 50——
62); the depreciation of the new generation ie reasoned on, and tmced to
jealonsy (vv. 63—89.) The love of novelty is then examined as a principle
(vv. 90—113) ‚- the turn it has taken at Rome in favour of literary habits is
described3 ite harmlessnese (v. 119, sqq), and its services to education (vv.
126-130) and to religion (vv. 132—138) are set forth, and then nn outline of
the rise os satir-ie and scenio composition (v. 139, sqq.)

Next, in scanning the defectu of Roman authorship‚ these are traced, not to
a want of spirit or invention, bnt of study and finish (u. 165); sometimes
to amercennry haste (υ. 175.) But even the more ambitione poet-s meet
with poor encouragement (vv. 182—207) from the public. For poets who are
contented to be simply read (v. 214) there is patronage, and that aa
deservedly (v. 229) as freely and judiciously bestowed (v. 245.) But upon
this they are foolish to presume Γυυ. 219—228) ς and if they claim it without
merit, they are ridiculons, and their traeh, ns it must be unacceptuble,
desei-ves only to be thrown away.

(This Epistle and the next are included in the Imitations os Horace by

Pope.)
