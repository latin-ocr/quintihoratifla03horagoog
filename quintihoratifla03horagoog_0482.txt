188 NOTBS ΟΝ THE SATIRES: BOOK 11. SAT. vr, vn.

’ἵ 5. Or. ea: Pont. 11. 111. 8,-—‘ Vulgus amicitias utilitate probat?

77. Aniles..Jabellas. Cp. Plato, Theaet. 85, p. 176‚—‹5 λεγόμενος γραῶν ὕθλος.
91. Nemoris...dorso. The same expression is in Viry. Geor. 111. 436.

95. This is commonly compared with Eurip. Alc. 782, sqq.

103. Conderet, “glowed, shone brilliantly;” a rare usage: the word is mostly
restricted to the idea of “whitenesS,” or “ heat.’'

107. Succinctus. So Eumaens entertaining Ulysses, Hom. od. xxv. 72,-ζωστῆρι
Ξζῗὲλσέἴέῗῃε χιτῶνα. Cp. also Ηεείοά, Sc. Herc. 287,-δπιστολάδην δὲ χιτῦνας

109. Ρτωῖαηιὸσηε, var. lect. proelibam, an elegant and probable reading, if it had
more MS. authority; and it is a more natural word to express the taster's
office. Yet, as [0.] remarks, considering that the verna here is a mouse,
proelambo is appropriate.

111. 219st laetwm convivam, ‘⁸ enjoys himself ;” literally, “ plays the guest z’' a form
of expression analogous to ducem profitetur, ‘⁶ shows the (skill and character of
a) general,” 00. Art. Am. 1. 181. Cp. Vir-y. AEn. 11. 591,—‘confcssa Deam.'
So in Moschus, Europa, 77,·-κρύψε θεόν, “he hid the god,” (i.e. his true
character as one.)

SATIRE Vll.

Davus, a slave, is here the speaker. He asks and obtains leave to retort
upon his master his own doctrines.

He begins by arguing that the fickle inconstant character is as worthless
as the wholly unscrupnlons. Horace himself is then lectured, as one who
praises the ‘⁸ good old times,'’ yet loves the luxury of the modern (υ. 23); who
loves the country when in town; who hates parties when not invited out;
but who, if invited, is off at a moment’s notice (vv. 30—35.) He is then com·
pared with his own dependents, whom he leaves in the lurch‚ and has abused
sor being discontented (v. 40.) But heis open to a worse contrast3 he is
not merely o)n a level with Mulvius the parasite, but with Davus the bought
slave v. 43.

The(contrast in this part is too coarse to be dwelt on, but concludes (υ. 68,
sqq.) that he who, after warning or escape, hankers for vice, or is restrained
only by circumstances, is as little upright as the thies, who is kept from
filching by publicity, is honest. He is ‘⁸ passion’s slave,” incapable of
emancipation by any ontward relief or change. “ who then is free ?’' The
question is finely answered (vv. 83—88); and the sense may be expressed

nearly in Hamlet's words,—
‘ One in suffering all that suffers nothing-3

‘ A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
‘ Has ta'en with equal thanks!

The subject passes on prosently to picture-fancying (v. 95), to the luxuries
of the table (v. 102), to their costliness (v. 110), to the miseries of restlessness
(υ. 112), indolence, and ennui. Here the lecture (as if it touched on a sore
point) is abruptly closed by the wrath os the listener.

4. Ut m‘talc putes, i. e. not too good to live. Cp. Ov. Am. 11. v1. 39,—
‘ Optima prima sere manibus rapiuntur avaris ς
‘ Implentur numeris deteriore suis.'

10. Clavum mutaret. See Dict. os Antiqq. art. ‘ ozam ,·' with the quotation from
Ovid, Trist. lv. x. 35,—‘ Clavi mensura coacta est!

12. Cp. Isocr. Or. xv,—-·vrtpl Ἀντιδ. 305,-ἐν. τ. ἀκολασίαις ἡμερεύειν ἐν αἷς πρότερον οὺδ“
ἂν οἰκέτης ἐπιεικὴς ουδεὶς ἐτόλμησεν.-Μιιπάἰον, i. e. ‘⁴ tho better class of
srecdmen.’'
