168 NOTES ΟΝ THE SATIRES: BOOK 11. SAT. II.

19. Cp. Cic. Tusc. Qu. v. 34‚—‘ Quis hoe non videt, desideriis omnia ista condiri?
‘ Darius in fuga...negavit umquam se bibisse jucundius!

20. Pztlmentcxria qnaere sudando. Cp. Cic. de Pin. 11. 28‚—‘ Cibi condimentum esse
famem, potionis sitim ς’ und Taso. Qu. v. 34.

22. Scams...zaq02·s. The scarus (s. specics of the {abr-us) was a fish highly prized
as a delicacy at Rome. It is found in shoals in the Mediterraneum Sea. The
Layois is probably the same as the attayen.

ib. Pereqrina, “ migratory.”
25. Vanis rerum, i. e. by a mere outside. Sat. ΙΙ. ΠΗ. 83‚—‘ fictis rerum!

ib. Veneat auro. ‘ Magis illa juvant qum pluris emmxtur? J αι’. 11. 16.

29. Hac mustis illa, i. e. vesceris hac poti ns quam illa, “ yet, though there is uo real
‘⁴ superior-ity, you eut this bird in preference to that.” Bentley makes huc to
be governed by distet, ‘³ though there is no excellence (lit. disset-enee) in this
“ meat more than in that, yet you are led by the differ-enee of look.'’

31. Unde datum. ‘ Unde traditum hunc intellectum habes Ρ’ Schol. “ By what
faculty cun you ‹liseern where your fish was caught Ρ whether in the river, or
the sea‚—high up the stream, or at the mouth ?’' The phrase is copied by
Persius, v. 1:34. Comp. Or. Fast. vl. 103,—‘ Unde datas habeat vires ' (“ ,whence
she derives her power.”)

ib. Ιηῳτιεελάθραξ, “ the Basse ;'’ a {ish of the perch tribe, common on our coasts,
and in the Mediterraneum (See Yam-eli on Ftshes.)

32. captus hiet. Hiet is not a mere redundancy for sit. We may eonstrue thus,—
“ Whether this fish was alto captus, which is gaping on the table before you.”
(There is a tolerably parallel instance of poetic usuage in Viry. AEn. VI. 471,—

‘ Quum si dura silex, aut· stet Marpesia cautes?
ΜΓ. Conington calls stet a poetieal substitute for sit ,- but he gives the verb a
meaning os its own in his version,—“ 'rhun if she had the fixedness of ssint «or

c .’'
33. Ττῗῑῗὸνίηι mullum. J tw. lv. 15,—

‘ Mullum sex milibus emit,
‘ AEquantem sane paribus sestertia libris?

i b. Mullum, ‘³ the red surmullet.'’ ‘ Mulli barbati in piscinis: Cic. ad Att. ΙΙ. 1. 7'.

34. In sinyula, i. e. “ a pieee sor eacb guest.”

36. Illis ...... his. The rulo is, that, of two persons or things, hic refers to the last
mentioned, ille to the more remote,—a rule seemingly violated here, for illis
is referred to lupos, his ta) mullum. But the construction is accounted for ou
the ground that the mulli are principally in the speakcr’s mind, und nearest
to him in idea.. This is the explanation of Jahn on Epist. 1. XVII. 19.

110. Guflazyulo ,- res pro persona. Cp. Juv. 1. 140.
ib. At υοε. ‘At indignantis est,' Orelli.
41. coquite. Said i1·0nically,—“ Come and dress (Le. taint) their viands. Yet
“ (why do I bid you do so Ρ) thoy are tainted (220. distustosul) owing 120
· “ excess'’ (mala copia.)
42. Putet...recens. A kind os oxymoron. “Though freshly caught, it is loathed
(putidus) by the jnded und sickly appetite.'' Juv. 11. 121,—
‘ Divitibus cenandi nulla voluptas ς
‘Nil rhombus, nil (lama. sapit; putere videntur

‘ Unguenta atque rosen, latos nisi sustinet orbes
‘ Grande ebur‚' etc.

44. Innlos, “ Elicampaue.” ‘ Inulas amaras} Sat. ΙΙ. vm. 51.
