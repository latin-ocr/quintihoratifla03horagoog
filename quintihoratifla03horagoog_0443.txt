NOTES ΟΝ THE SATIRES: BOOK I. ΒΑΓ. vi. 149

140,er suppose Ι did (v. 19,) there are rivals who might be preferred to
me, and 1 might even be absolutely rejected as disqualified : nay, I should de-
serve it, by straining beyond my proper sphere. But, I might plead,—Who
does not wish to rise above his sphere P On the other hand, is any happier for
doing so? Or what does he gaiu but criticism and censure?

Such are the principles I maintain. I have, in aecor-(lance with them, kept ·

clear of popular ambition‚ and therefore claimed exemption from the jealousies
wliaeylletzgzearztiaeltb not to official rank, or conferred by public caprice: it is
due to private sentiment and moral estimation. This is not a matter of
chance, nor sor jealousy. I have a right to these honours, and I thank my
patron, and him who by education fitted me for such patrouago.

1. Lydorum...Etr-usc08. Cp. Vir-9. AEn. Π. 781; lx. 11. Herodotus (1. 94) gives
the story of Lydian emigration to Etruria. The account in Herodotus of the
Lydian emigratiou is contradicted by Dion ysius IIulic. 1, and doubt is thrown
upon its value as historical fact. For a description of the races of Etruria,
their name-s and language, see Varronianus, ch. 1. with the map by the title-
page, and ch. v. ξ 11. The conclusion there obtained is, that the country was
inhabited chiefly by two distinct peoples, Tyrrheni and Etrusci.

(α.) The Tyrrheni were a branch of the great Pelasgiau family. Sophocles
(Inach. Fr. 256) combines the two names, Τυρσηνοῖσι Πελασγοῖς. Both in fact
are descriptive names, and are translated: l. “ The tower-buildors,'' from
τύρσις, i. o. turris (cp. Pindon Ol. 11. 70), the Pelasgian settlements being
everywhere marked by gigantic “ Cyclopean '⁹ buildings : and 2. “ 'l'he
swarthy AsiaticS,'’ (Vorr. p. 37.)

(β) The Etrusci, or Hetrusci, were probably of the same stock as the Roeti .-
they are supposed to have invaded and conquered the 'Pyt-rheni, who may, how-
ever, have remained in the country as περίοικοι, especially in South Etruria,
while the dominaut race held the citicS. ( From Liv. x. 4, and lx. 36, it is
infcrred that the town language differt-d from that of the country; also that
the country dialect of Caere was intelligible as sar north as Clusium.) The
Etrusci called themselves Raseno. (Ρασένα, Dionys), a name perhaps cognate to
Raett ,· probably meaning “ rapid;” and, if so, a natural designation of a warrior
tribe. Donaldson compares the πόδας ὠκύς of Homer, and the Roman term for
their anciently highest clas-3, Celeres ,- and remarks by the way, that a lead-
ing thian tribe has the epithet veloces, in Hor. C. IV. xlv. 11.

4. Leqionibas. These must have been foreign, i. e. Etruscan armies, for thero is
no Cilnius or Maecenas among the consular names at Rome. Merivale, Hist. ch.
xxvn. vol. 111. p. 271, (note.)

5. Naso suspendis adunca, “ you sneer at.” Cp. Sat. ΙΙ. vm. 643 and Pers. 1. 42,—
‘Rides,' ait, ‘ et nimis uncis
‘ Naribus indulges ;’
and v. 118‚—‘Excusso populum suspendere naso?

8. Dum inqemms, i. e. provided he bo freeborn‚ no slave. This general patronage
could not of course include slaves. But the son of a libertinas was considered
1ξνηὲιειηιιπως. Some (as Gesner) understand it as-——inqenuis moribus ; not so

9. Tulli...iqm>bile reanum. Juv. vlu. 25,—
‘ Ancilla natus trabeam et diadema Quirini,
‘ Et fasces meruit regum ultimus ille bonorum.’

(obs. that the contrast of the succeeding lines there is drawn from ‘juvenes
ipsius consulis ' (Brutus), as here from ‘ Valeri genus.‘)
12. Loevinum. Laevinus was a cognomen of the qens Valeria.

15. Iudice quo nosti, i. e. “ such a judge as you are aware it is ;” (not therefore the
same in meaning· as quem nosti, ‘⁶ whom you know personally.” Compare the
difference of nosti qai sit homo and nosti hominem.) For instances of this
