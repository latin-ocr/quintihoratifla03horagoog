100 NOTES ΟΝ Tm: ODES .· BOOK Π. vn, vin.

The choice of poetic figure, by which to enlm-ge the simple notion cum semel
occideris, was probably suggested by Torquatus' own profession as an advocate
(alluded to in Ep. Ι. v. 8, 9 . 'I'hen splendida will mark the contrast between

‘⁸ the grand last doom ” as ΜΓ. Conington translates) and the common
earthly law-courts and trials.

26. Liberat Hippolytum. According to a later, and Latin legend, Hippolytus was
« restored. Viry. AEn. ΠΙ. 765.

CARM. VIIL—AD CENSORINUM.

Caius Marcius Censorinus, Cons. Β. c. 8. Patercnlus says of him, that hc was
ξὲιῖιοὲο do good, and win men's hearts by it,—‘ demetendis hominibus genitus:

1. Dona-rem, ἂς. Cp. Ouid, ex Pont. IV. vlu. 31, sqq. Gii'ts on particular and
marked days, on birthdays‚ New Year's Day, (hence the allusion in Tibull. ΙΙΙ.
1. 1, sq.)‚ or the Saturnalia, were customary at Rome; and they arc ιο be
reckoned (see Palcy's Introduction to Ovid’s Pasti) among the influenccs
exercised upon modern society by Roman usage. The French have even
derived their term for New Year’s gifte, ‘estrennesss from the Latin ‘strenoe ς’

igr an αοοοιιιὲιὸζΐ which see the Dict. Anti-q. in voce, (and see Walckn. Hist.
cruce, xus. .

3. Tripodas praemia. Cp. Hom. Il. ψ. 2593 Vim. AE'n. v, 110.
5. Artium, tle. “works of art.’' So ‘Didymaonis artes: Virq. AEn. v. 359.

ib. Protulit. ‘ Bene de re nova et admiranda,’ [G.] ‘Exquisitmn verbum tan·
quam inventor artis fuerit quam perfecisset. Eodem s. Tibul-l. x. 1.’ [M.]

ib. Scopas, of Paros, architect end sculptor. His statue of Apollo (placed
eventually by Augustus in the temple on the Palatino) is described very

happily by Propertius, ΙΙ. xxxl. 5. He was the artist engaged on the decore·
tion of the Mausoleum, i.e. about 350, Β. e.

10. Delicta-rum. Cicero uses this word in the same sense, Verr. tv. 23; and ‘hinc
Seneca, Hipp. 210‚—‘ domos delicatas talibus refertas vocat? [M.]

12. Pretium dicere, ‘⁴ ιο assign the true velue to 3 ιο appraise the gift?

‚13. Notis, i.e. “ inscriptions? For the sentiment, cp. Epist. Π. 1. 248. Orelli sup-
poses a reference here to tho statues set up by Augustus in his forum, as a
gellcry of great men. Steiner conjectures that the subsequent ideas (vv. 15-
17) are founded on some groups in statuat-y or paintin3', representing Scipio’s
conquesta.

17. Non incendia. This, in its most natural sense, signifies the destruction of the
city in the 3rd Punic war. By some it is understood of the burning of the
camp, Div. xxx. 5, or the fleet, Liv. xxx. 43‚——so as to refer the whole sub-
ject to the elder Africanus. It might perhaps, as [M.] suggests, be taken fot·
a metaphor corresponding to Virgil's ‘ tanti incendia belli,' AEn. 1. 556. Bent-
ley and others condemn the verse as spuriouS, on account of the apparent
confusion between the two Scipios, also on account os tho defect in caesura.
