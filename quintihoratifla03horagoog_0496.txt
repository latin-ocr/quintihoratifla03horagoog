EPISTLE VL—AD NUMICIUM.

'Phe moral of this epistle may be in part represented by Milton’s line
Comus, 210),—
( ’ ‘ These thoughts may startle well, but not astound
‘ The virtuous mind.’

It opens with a proverb from the Greek, which in its original meaning
denoted the characteristic fearlessness of the well-balanced mind, free from
amazement or superstitious alarm at natural phenomena; but which might
be, and here is, brought to bear upon moral causes of disquietude as well.
These are the admiration and desire of wealth and power, of popular distinc-
tions (vv. 5—-14; 17—23)‚ the real value of which is tested by Time and Death
(vv. 24—27.) True wisdom is never in excess (v. 16> ; the real excellence os
life is found in virtue (v. 30„ if not, let a man indulge his bent without re-
spect to virtue ; enrich himself without scruple as to means (υ. 32, sqq.) ς gratify
his ambition as he will (v. 49, sqq. ), or his luxury (v. 56, sqq.)

The subject seems at first sight unfinished3 we should have expected the
counter-priuciple of v. 30 to be advocated in its turn; but it is left sor in-
ference, and loses nothing perhaps of its soree, if fairly studied3 helped out

as it is by the evident irony of such lines as 36—385 45—47 ; 62—ssss
