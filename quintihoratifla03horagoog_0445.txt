NOTES ΟΝ THE SATJRES: BOOK 1. sAT. vx. 151

54. Olim. So in v. 47. This word seems to imply that the satire was written at a
{ensiffeffible interval after Philippi. See further markings of time in Sat.

57. Infans, not “ speechless ” absolutely, but “ slow of speech ;'‘ used nearly in the

primitive sense. Lucret. (v. 1030) has the subst. ‘ infantia, linques! Cic. de

Ol. Or. Lxxx. 278,—‘ Ubi ardor animi qui etiam ex infantium ingeniis elicere
‘voces et querellas solet-¹

59. Satureiano. Satureium, or Saturium, was in the neighbourhood os Tarentum·
Orelli quotes mention of it in the oracle κινεῖ) to Phalanthus, in Sti-,abo VI·
111. 2 ,-Σατύρι όν τοι δῶκα Τάραντά τε πίονα δῆμον.

ib. Caballo. A rustic &low-class term for “horses;” yet the term from which
the Fr. cheval, the Eng. chivalry and cavalry are derived.

67. Naems. Cic. de C'l. Or. 313‚—‘ Totum me non naevo aliquo ant crepundiis, sed
‘ corpore omni videris velle cognoscere'

68. Mola lustra, “lew haunts, soenes of dissipation.” Cp. Lucret. tv. 1132,—
‘ Desidiose agere aetatem lustrisque perire! Cp. Liv. xxv. 43. '

71. {ui τνὲἷονο Ραυὲοζ welle, i. e. “ poor as he was, he ufforded me a better educa·
ion an usu . '

72. Elam: ludum, i. e. the grammar school of the place.
74. Suspensi. Cp. ὁ τὴν πήραν ἐξηρτημένος, Lucian, Vit. Auct. v11.

75. octonis...I«zibu.s, i. e.. “ the Ides of eight months in the year.’' Martial (x. 62)
clearly implies that the schools were closed for the four summer months, from
the Ides of June to those of October. His lines are as follow ε
‘Ludi magister parce simplici tux-..bae

‘Albae Leone flammeo calent luces,
‘Tostamque fervens Julius coquit messem :
‘Cirrata loris horridis Scythae pellis,

‘Qua vapulavit. Marsyas Celaeneus,
‘berulaeque tristes, sceptra paedagogorum,
‘Cessent et Idus dormiant 111 Octobres)

Octonis has been variously explained. 1.‘ Quia Idus omnes in octavum post
Nonas diem incidunt,' (but this according to Roman calculation is not true.)
2. ‘ Sive, ut ait Lambinus, Iduum dies sunt octo.' [0.] 3. ‘ De exercitiis
puerorum qui computarent tera-,³ i. e. ‘ qnae Idibus exigerentur. Octonae...quia
post Nonas sunt octo? (Zeun.) 4. It has been thought that octonae may be
equivalent to ⁴ Octobres! (There is something plausible in this last, if it be
not an anachronism ς for the year in the Augustan age began with J anuary,
not March, as anciently.) But the interpretation given first of all is the best.
The only difficulty is Macrobius’ statement that ‘ Martio mense mercedem
exsolvebant magistris quam completus annus deberi fecit? (Macr. saturn. 1.
12.) But this is done away by Becker's explanation, that the monthly pay-
ments and the four months’ holiday belonged only to the poorer and inferior
schools. In the higher schools the payments were annual, and made prob-
ably in March, after the Quinquatria. He cites Or. Fast. 111. 829. The verse
of Juvenal, x. 116,—‘ Quisquis adhuc uno partam colet asse Minervam,’ he in·
terprets as referring to the minema, or entrance see. (See the dissertation
in Becker-’s Gallus, especially p. 191.)

78. Vestem servosque. It was natural that a raised scale of expenses, and an at-
tendance not needed at the provincial school, or where the poet's grado in life
was known and defined, might be called for, as the consequence of sending
him to Rome. The number of attendant slaves was a standard of wealth.
'l‘his is implied in Sat. Ι. 111. 12. Comp. Jur. 111. 141,-‘ Quot pascit servos ?'
