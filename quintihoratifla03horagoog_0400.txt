40. Amqavit, ‘⁴ and has added a fresh glory to your past commands.'’ ‘ Arroqare
{gtiquffikeztligocto vocabuli usu pro addere. ΟΡ. Liv. vn. 25, and Epist. 11. 1.

44. Dominae. Ου. Fast. Π. 831‚—· Dominaeque potentia terrm!

45. Ov. Am. 111. Vt. 40.

4¹7. Beluosus. The Homeric μεγακήτης. Some take it as corresponding to J uvenal's
allusion, Β. 1. 14,-‘ Quanto delphinis balaena Britannica major! But compare
also Tac. Αηη. 11. 24,—‘ Quidam in Britanniam rapti et remissi...miracula

‘ narrabant vim turbinum et inauditas volucres, monstra maris ambiguas
‘ hominum et beluarum formas?

1. Phaebm volentem. ΟΡ. viv-9. Ecl. Ἡ. 3,--‘ Cum canerem reges,' etc.

2. Increpuit lyra, “checked me with his lyre.” 'I'he same phrase occurs in the
last line of Ovid’s Fasti, expressing assent or approval. It seems to be one
naturally applicable to a χοροδιδάσκαλος, who would interrupt (for correction
or guidance) the musician, by striking notes on his own instrument.

8. Ne parva, sq. ΟΡ. Pope’s adaptation of this metaphor to poetic fame, Essay on
Han, lv· 385’— ‘ Say shall my little bark attendant sail,
⁶ Pursue the triumph and pai-take the gale Ρ '

4. Vazi» amm. Used by virgil with the same metaphor,—‘Pe1agoq1m volans da
vela patenti! Gom-9. 11. 41.

8. Postibus. For the custom of suspending conquered spoils thus, seo Vir-9. AEn.
111. 287,—‘ Postibus adversis figo ς’ and vn. 183.

9. Janum Quirini, i. e. “closed the war-gete of Quirinus‚” (the tutelam· deity.)
This has been altered by editors to Jamwm Qua-fremat», as the appellation more
usual in invoking Janus, but there is no MS. authority for the change, nor
was Horace tied to that form in mentioning, not the god, but his temple,
especially if (as Bentley suggests) Quin'vms in the common formula was used
adjectively. Quirinus was the name under which Romulus was worshipped,

(ΟυὲἸΓαεί. 11. 475) and is a name assigned to Augustus in γίνῃ. Geor-9.

10. Evaqanti. Used actively, with acc. case. The same force of ex in compounds
is seen in exeo, evado, excedo, erep0. Still these verbs, though transitive, aro
not used in the passive voice.

12. Veteres...artes. ‘Vetuste pro antiquos mom-3, vel virtutes, Graecis &pu-ds? [G.]
Compare Vim. AEn. VI. 852,—
‘ Tu regere imperio populos, Romane, mement03
‘ 11ae tibi erunt artes!
ΟΡ. too Ov. Fast. 11. 508,-‘ Et patrias artes militiamque colant!

14. Imperi...majestas. Cic. pro Καὶ). 73 de Orat. 11. 39 ; Quint-il. VII. 111. 35.

15. Ortus. Many editions read ortum here, with some MS. authority, but entirely
against the usage of the best Latin authors ε for, with the exception of the
phrase ab ortu, (o. q. in Οαν-ιη. 111. xxvn. 12) the plural is regularly used as a
general term of description, where the meaning is not restricted. (We may
observe a parallel in the Gr. ἃντολαί.) Thus Viry. AEn. vl. 255,-‘ Sub lumina
solis et ortus? Goon-9. 111. 277,-· N on, Eure, tuos neque solis ad ortus! En.
lv. l18‚—‘ Ubi primos crastinus ortus Extulerit Titan! Comp. Geor-9. lv. 544.
In Or. Met. xW. 386, the substitution of ortum for ortus seems due, as here, to
