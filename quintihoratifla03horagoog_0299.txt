40. Voltus. In this and the like words vulqus, volnus, 1 follow Orelli’s text, and re·
taiu the older' form: yet the common forms vultus, etc. which I place among
the various readings, had come into use as early as Quintilian's time. He
says of them (1. ιν. 11) ‘ nunc scribitur vulqus et sermzsst (not servos.) He
gives (Ι. vn. 26) the reason for the old form, ‘quia subjecta sibi vocalis in
unum-sonum coalescere 61 confundi nequiret ;' i. e. the Romans had a difficulty
in pronouncing uu, whether as a diphthong (6.9. 111 quwm, σφωε) or as, 111
Quintilian’s phrase, zitterae sibi insidentes ‚- ι’.6. 86611113 6116 611 1116 other, with
a consonantal power given 16 the first letter.

The same peculim-{ty held in the letter i, thus, abicere, or else abjecere, is an
older form 111611 abjicere. On the other hand, where i came between vowels, as
in aio, Maia, (which Cicero is said to have written aiio, Mar-iia) there was
iotacismus, or doubling of the i in pronunciation. Wagner quotes as the rule,
unam ι’ scribi, dwplicem audiri. Augustus 16 said (Suet. 88) 16 have sav oured the
phonetic princilge, ‘perinde scribendum 66 loquamur! (866 1116 Orthoqr. Verq.

really more 111611 man, and but lent 16 1116 661111 for a time. Perhaps it is as
