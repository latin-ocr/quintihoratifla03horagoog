v. EST) has established the legitimacy of this form, both in
prose and poetry; and he has printed it throughout his
Virgil. Lachmann cites a profusion of instances for it (Imcr.
1. 9933 111. 954.) The MSS. of Lucretius and Virgil ex-
hibit it constantly. In those of Horace, as less ancient, the
evidence for it is sparing ε a few instances occur in B, chiefly,
it may be remarked, in the Ars Poetica5 one of them (in
v. 386) is confirmed by κ, which gives judicium sit ; and
in the same MS. I find at S. II. 111. 221, the reading qui
scelerat' est, evidently=sceleratu3t. Again, the not· unfre-
quent omission of est at the close of a verse, e. 9. S. 1. rx. 42, ·
II. v. 8, may indicate the form. I have received it only
where so quoted by Lachmann, and shewu to be necessary by
his rules, adding an instance not cited by him in Epod. xv.
123 and Ι have placed it (wherever Ι conceive it admissible)
among the Various Readings 3 with the double advantage of
suggesting it as probably correct, and of allowing their choice
to those who prefer the accepted text.

I have-consulted the notes of Lambinus, Gesner, Mitscher-
lich, C. Fea, the Delphin, Bentley, Orelli 3 and the lists also
of Various Readings in Obbar, for the lst Book of Epistles‚
and in Keller, for the Odcs, The latter presents a very large
collation of MSS„ but, with the exception of a few correc-
tionS, has not much of value to add to Orelli's list. Hc
exhibits the orthography of Ritschel and Fleckeisen, and
some curicus innovations in the text: e. y. Bentley's con-

jecture in Ι. xx111. 53 discere for ducere, III. 111. 343
ascias for arcus, ΙΙΙ. xxvi. 7 3 and Epod. v. 88.
