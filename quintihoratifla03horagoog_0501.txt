NOTES ΟΝ THE EPISTLES.- BOOK Ι. EPIST. vul, lx. 207

Horace, if he must censure, does it covertly,—he is amiculus, docendus
adhuc (see below, Ep. xvn. 3.) That his own character, however, was want-
ing in fixedness of purpose, he seems to have been sincerely conscious. (See
the reflections in the opening of Sat. 11. 111. and Sat. 11. vu. (vv. 22—29.)

This Epistle is to be compared with the Third, being written to one of the
same suite (cohors) ,- probably to the same Celsus as there mentioned, v. 15.

1. Ggmlzre ...... yerere, aform of salutation (as again in v. 15.) Gr. χαίρειν καὶ

2. Royan, “ at my request,” not τομαῖα α celse, as the next line (si quaeret) shows.

3. Si quoeret, quid αθατιηὲ· Comp. Qu. Aga. 1. xl. 13; and Ifrist. Ι. 1. 17,—
‹vivem ωᾏᾳῶἒέἓῐιέὲῖἒῖω ἵξῗὲἑῖἓέἕὲ 3ἓὲιωῖἓῖ Μ’
Π). ΙΙΙ. VIII. 63 and TheoqniS, 519,—
ὴν δέ τις εἰρωτᾷ τὸν ἐμὸν βίον ὧδέ οἱ εἰπεῖν,
ὥς εὖ μὲν χαλεπῶς, ὡς χαλεπῶς δὲ μάλ’ εὖ.

12. The marked mention of Tibur in Horace's later poetry (here, for instance, and
in Oarm. IV. 11. 31 ς IV. 111. 10) has raised the question whether he had any
residence there, either lent or leased to him. [O.] refers to Carm. -ΙΙ,
1v111. 14, as proving that he had but one country residence, and that situated
in confiniis aqi-i Sabini et Tiburtini. But granting that the ayer Tiburtinus
may have bordered on the σθεν Sabinus, there is no doubt that Horace's farm
was at least ten or fifteen miles from Tibur itself. In fact, the nearest town·
ship was Varia (see Ε. Ῑ. xlv. 3,) eight miles beyond Tibur. Again, the life
attributed to Suetonius speaks of his living ‘plurimum in secessu ruris sni
‘ Sabini aut Tiburtini,’ (aut, “ or else,” implies that the tcrms used are not
synonymous, but distinctive) ‘ domusque ejus ostenditur circa Tiburni luculum.'
Again, in Car-m. 111. lv. 22, Horace appears clearly to distinguish his Sabine
resident-e from Tibur3 nor does he throw out any hint of his Sabine valley
being connected with Tibur, or owing any charm to it. Compare the detailed
description in Ε. 1. 16, and the incidertal references to it in Ε. 1. xvlu.

EPISTLE IX.—AD CLAUDIUM NERONEM.·

An introductory letter written to Tiberius, showing great tact in the avoid-
ance of the difficulties of a false position. His friend Septimius, supposing
him to be influential‚ presses him to write it. He believes he has no influonce,
and knows he has no authority to ask a favour. Forccd. however, by tbe
plea of friendship, hc complies in ternis as brief and decisivo as they are

unpresuming.
