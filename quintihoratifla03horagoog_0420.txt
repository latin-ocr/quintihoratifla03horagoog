ἔσχεν οἰκῆσάι τὰς (Μακάρων) νήσους, κ. τ. λ. ’

44. Inmutata, as inarata, “ needing no cultivation.’' (Compare with this descrip-
tion generally, Virq. Ecl. Π.)

bably means not disappointinq.)

‘ Nec gregibus nocturnus obambulat!

ib. nepe-tinus, i. e. vespere, as ‘nocturnus in this quotation. There is the same
usage in Sat. 11. lv, 17. Viry. AEn. vul. 465‚—‘ AEneas sc matutinus agebat!

ib. Ursus. Cp. Ov. Met. vn. 546,—‘ Armentis incurrere fortibus ursi!

54. Radat. The same verb is used oi the dry cold north wind in Sat. ΙΙ. vx. 25.
'rho general description is modelled on Hom. od.. 8. 566,-

sails seaward ς we set sassl' Comae, “ the tips os the sail-yards.’'

ib. Sidonii, i.e. “Phoenician mariners.’' Orelli compares the Homeric epithet
Φοίνικες πολυπαίπαλοι (“ crafty,’') Odyss. ο. 419. The sense is (vv. 57-60,) “ no

5. Refioea coelo. A phrase applied to shooting stare or meteors in Via-9. AEn. v. 527.

7. Retro solve. RetrO, if joined with solve, may be understood of the reverse action
of the wheel‚ when the pulleys that whirl it arc dctached, or (which indeed is
much the same thing) the undoing the charm. But it seems better to join it
with citum, taken as a participle, not as an adjective. Thou the construction
will be-——‘ cie retro. ac solve,' i. e. “ whirl it back, and let it rest.” citus is a
participle in Ep. lx. 20; Lucret. 1. 99'7; 11. 85. Lambinus, to avoid Joining
retro, which implies motion, with solvo, a verb of rest, conjectured volve.
