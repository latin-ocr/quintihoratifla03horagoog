NOTES ΟΝ THE SATI-RES: BOOK 11. SAT. Π. 169

47. Galloni. Publius Gallonius. Cic. de Pin. 11. 8, quotes the verse of Lucilius
“90¹² Μῶν( Ο Publi, ο gurges, Galloni; es homo miser, inquit; η
‘ Cenasti in vita numquam bene, cum omnia in ista
‘ Consumis squilla atque acipensere cum decimano.¹

ib. Acipensm, “ a sturgeon.'' martial, x111. 91.

50. Αιιεΐσν...Ρτωὲονίῑιε. Sempronius Rufus, notorious for his epicurism, and re-
pulsed on account of it, when suing for the praetorship. Praetorius is a
sar-castic joke upon his sailure. He was the inventor (auctor) of this new
delicacy‚—a dish of storks ; and the following epigram connected it with his

repulse (Obs. conditoris from condio) .-
‘ Ciconiarum Rufus iste conditor!
‘ Hic est duobus elegantior Plancist
‘ Suffragiorum puncta non tulit septem.
‘ Ciconiarum populus ultus est mortem.'

51. Edioeerit, scil. tamquam proetor ,- another hit at Rufus. Edico was the regular
word for conveying the praetor’s decree.

55. ΡΊνὸιιίαηι. ‘ Ita, ut pravus fias,’ Orelli. (Bentley reads pravus, as in sat. 1. w.

ib. Avidienus. Unknown except from this passage.

56. Dictum, al. ductum, which Orelli looks on as a mere gloss. In favour of dictum,
he quotes Liv. 1. 1,—‘ Cui Ascanium parentes dixere nomen.’ But Ov1d, a
great imitator of Horace, is cited on the other side, Fast. 1. 467,—

‘ Nomen habes a carmine ductum.'

57. Quinquennes, i. e. so old as to be spoilt.
ib. Est, i. e. edit.
58. Mutuum, “ on the turu.” So, vitio mutaverit, sat. 11. VIII. 50.

59. {abnui-balbam celebret, i. e. “ although he makes a great show of cele·
rating em.''

⁵ 60. ξερὲίδία, “ the day after a marriage ’³ (or, indeed, any entertainment.) Gr. ·
πί C· -

61. Albam, i. ο. “ with a'new οι- newly-cleaned toan‘ Pers. 11. 5¹⁰·

ib. Ipse ...... instillat. The emphasis is ·on both words. “ He himself pours ont
“ the rancid oil drop by drop ,· and the old vinegar (=mutatu.m vinum) is the
“ only thing of which he is not chary.‘’

ib. Bilibri. A conyius is estimated (see Dict. Ant. art. ‘ Libra ¹) to contain lOlbs.
weight. At this proportiou a cornu. bilibre would slightly exceed a sextarius.

62. Non parcus. In some copies non lav-qus is read. [G.] appi-oves it: ‘ironiam
haud agnovit‚’ says [G.] It has the appearance of being a mere correction,
founded on mistake arising from the involved nature of the sentence ; for at
first sight the clause seems naturally to attach itself to the preceding cornu...
instillat. But the use of the word aceti forbids this, and shows that the
clause is a return to the mention of vinum, in v. 58. · ln eo solo non avarus:

Schol.
64. Aiunt. Gr. τὸ imapum or (as in Aristophanes), τοῦτ’ ἐκεῖνο.

65. Mundus erit qua non, etc. Bentl. and Orelli concur in supporting qua for qui.
The sense need not be affected by it. Qui might be--quippe qui. Qua is=
eatenus qua, or (as it is in Sat. Ι. 11. 123) hactenus ut. ‘⁶ He (i. e. sapiens) will
“ be neat so as not to disgust by meanness, and in neither direution will be ex·
“travagant in style of living.” .Cp. Carm. 11. xvi. 14, and note.) Mundus

⁴ expresses the character between the prodigal and the miserly.
