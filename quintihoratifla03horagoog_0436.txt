48. At, “ but (you will say),'' etc. Pater, sc. ‘⁸ iu the play²² (persomtus,v. 56.) See·
Terent. Heaut. V. 1. 47, sqq.

54. Puris, κυρίοις ὀνόμασι, “ unadorned, unmetaphoxioalss’ Ars Poet. 2343.
60. Non. Connect with invenias, (v. 62.)
60, 61. Vemes taken from Ennius, imitated Vir-9. AEn. vn. 622.

64. I llud, used of what follows, as in v. 7 7. Cp. Liv. xxvl. 13,—‘ Illud irae...
indicium est.’ Madv. Gr. 485, quotes Cic. Di vin. 1. 10, ‘ tum ill-ud imprimis ’Ξ
“ the following circumstance particularly.'’ So in Greek, ἐκεῖνος, as in soph.
Aj. 943 and by itself elliptically‚ as in Eur. Phoen. 519,-ἐιιεῖνο δ’, οὐχ ἑκὼν
μεθήσομαι, where, from its being supposed to depend on μεθήσομαι, ἐκείνου was
read by Porson: but the old reading is attested by Bacchae, 771,-τά τ’ ἀλλ’
ἐστὶν μέγας, κάκεῖνο, φασὶν αὖτον.ζ“ἶᾰμπελον δοῦναι βροτοῖς = and by Erec-theim,
Fra . XVII. 43,—

9 ἐκεῖνο δ,’ οὗ τὸ πλεῖστον ἐν κοινῷ μέρος,
οὐκ ἔσθ’ ἑκούσης τῆς ἐμῆς ψυχῆς ἄτερ
προγόνων παλαιὰ θέσμι’ ὅστις ἐκβαλεῖ.
In all these instances ἐκεῖνο is put-absolutely, ‘⁸ and this too‚'' or '‘ but this 1
say.” The same construction may hold good sor δορὴ. Philoct. 310 3 but it is
pointed in the editions as ir ἐκεῖνο was an accusative after θέλει.

‘ culpa nonnulla est.’

86—100. The sense is,-—“ You often see at a party one invited whose whole
“ occupation (or profession) is to banter the rest. You call him a free-spoken
“ agreeable man. Yet you call me niqer, 11· vid-us, etc. N ow‘I will give you an
“ instance which really deserves those epithets.’' ......

86. Quaterrws. The distributive numeral, ‘⁴ four on each conch, i. e. twelve in all.''
A somewhat crowded party therefore (Compare Cic. in Pis. 27‚—‘ Nihil apud
hunc lautum, nihil elegans‚...Groeci stipati, quini in lectulis, saepo plures,')
and crowded for the sake of some uveibra or scurra, who would afford amuse-
ment.

87. Cp. Eur. Melamp. Fr. 29,—

ἆνδρῶν δὲ πολλοὶ τοῦ γέλωτος οὕνεκα
ἀσκοῦσι χάριτας κερτόμους’ ἐγὼ δέ πως
μισῶ γελοίους οἵτινες μὲν ἐπὶ σοφῶν
ἀχάλιν’ ἔχουσι στόματα.
