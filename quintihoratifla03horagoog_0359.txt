Nonis ΟΝ THE ODES: BOOK ΠΙ. 1v. 67

2. Calliope. Horace invokes the several Muses (without distinction -of their
offices) as suits his verse. Cp. Carm. Ι. ι. 335 Ι. 111. 23 111. xxx. 16. virgil
invokes all under the one name (AEn. 11. 525),—‘ Vos, o Calliope!

8. Sm...seu‚ zze. ‘vel tibia, vel assa voce, vel denique lyra-⁸ [O.] Mr. Conington
⁸ believes, with Ritter, that the alternative is between the pipe as accompany-
‘ ing the vom amtta, and the lyre as accompanying the οοω yravis. Horace has
‘ specified the voa: acuta, and left the vom yram's to be inserted! .

9. Fabulosoe, as in Oarm. Ι. xxn. 7. The story is well compared by Addison,
Spectator, 85, (and Keble, Praelect. ΗΠ.) with the old ballad, ‘ The children in

the Wood.’

10. Altvicissznerice κουροτρόφος. Cp. soph. Aj. Soa—&s τροφῆς ἐμοί, (sc. πέδια.)

Sec more in Presace, p. vi. .

11. Ludo sabbatumque somne, corresponding to the Homeric καμάτῳ ἂδδηκότες ἠδὲ
καὶ ὕπνῳ. I l. κ. 98. Properly itis an instance of the figure called zmyrna:

. bado sat-iqatum, victimaque somno.
13. Quodsoret, “a thing which might well be marvellous to all ;’' viz. “how (ut) 1
slept in safety.” (Miror is followed by ut, ‘⁴ how,'’ in Epocz. XVI. 53.)
14. Acherontem, Bantia, Forentum, towns in the neighbourhood of Venusia.
20. ‘ Sleep as sound as careless infancy.’ shakesp. Mem-y wives, Act V. Sc. v.
'21.· Vester, “ under your protection.'’
22. Tollor, used of mounting a height, in Ου. Met. vn. 779. Cp. Vir-9. AEn. 11. 635.

26. Versa acia, the rout at Philippi. Carm. ΙΙ. vn. 9
27. Devota...arbor. Cam. 11. 1111. 1—12. Devota, “ accursed.”

28. Palinurus, a dangerous promontory S. of Velia, on the Lucanian coast. For
its name and legend, see Viro. AEn. Vl. 881. Horace is supposed to have been
in danger of shipwreck there, in the Sicilian expedition against S. Pompeius
in ac. 36, when the fleet of Octavian was caught in a heavy stoi-m. (See Closs.
Muscam, vol. 11. p. 206, Essay by T. Dyer.) ”

ib. Omanmn, a Cantabrian tribe on the N. coast of Spain.

36. Amnem, the Tanais.

38. Abdidit is the most common reading. Bentl. preferred reddidit. Orelli reads
addidit, πλε. as colonists, confirming the reading by Tac. Ana. 1111. 31,—
‘ Coloniae...additis veteranis firmatae sunt!

41. Leno mummium. “ temperate counsels and moderatiori after victory.‘' Orelli
quotes a remarkable parallel from Pina. Pyth. v. 61,—

δίδωσί τι Μοῖσαν οἷς ἂν ἐθέλῃ
ἀπόλεμον ἀγαγὼν
ἐς πραπίδας εὐνομίαν

But this Ode, in the general, seems framed after the lst Pythian (see the
argument there, with the remarks on it, in Oookesley’s edition.) Consilium,
a trisyllable, as below Garm. vl. 63 and as connubia, Virq. AEn. vn. 555.
