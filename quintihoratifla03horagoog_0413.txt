CARM. IX.—AD MAECENATEM.

A triumphant celebration of the victory of Actium.

5. Tibiis.. lyra„ The lyre and flutes were commonly used in mutual accompani-
ment. They are mentioned together in Hom. Il σ. 4953 Theocr.1⁴)pi9r. 5,
Pindar, Ol. 111. 8, xl. 93. There is in the British Museum a set of tibica with

alyr,e which were found together ιιι a tomb at Athens. Pairs of tibio were
more frequently used than the single instrument. They were distinct, not
united‘ ιιι one, but the mouth· ·pieces were sometimes passed through a band
(capistrum.) Herodotus (1. 17), in speaking oi the martial musio of the
Lydians, makes mention of συρίγγων, πηκτίδων, and αὐλοῦ voveant-nime καὶ
ἂνδρηΐου, i. ο. (probably) tibioe sinistra et ἀει-ιτα, our “''treble and‘ ‘ltenor'

The two tibioe may have resembled our hautboy and bassoon. (The first is
the natural treble of the latter.)

6. Doriwm. ..barbonem The ancient music had three principal modes (i. e. scales
of different pitch), —the Dorian, Phrygian‚ and Lydian. Each was one tone
higher than the other. The Dorian was the lowest. The Phrygian (here
called barbarum) the next.

7. See Met-232¹,ale nist. Rome, vol. 111. ch. 27, (p. 246.)

ib. Neptunias. S. Pompey assumed the title of ‘ Son of Neptune) Dio, nvm. 19.
8. Ustis navibus. So. by Octavian. Dio, xuni. 10.

12. Εηιατιοίραίιιε, “ made over,'' as slave, or subject ιο. From manue, cap-ie, as ex·
pressing the legal symbol for transfer of land or any property, are derived
maceps, “ a purchaser, or owner,'’ „mancipi-um, “ a sale, contract, or ownership,”
or “ a slave,'’ as in E. I. Vl. 39. Sc, res mancipi.- manci-po, “ I transfer or make
over ιο,” as in E. 11. 11. 159. Hence, emacipo is properly “ to give up out of
one’s own power, to release, or free ;” and with a dative, as here, “ to sell or
surrender.” So it is used by Plaut. Bacchid. Ι. ι. 59,—‘ Tibi me emancupo:

tuus sum.’ So by cic. Phil. 11. 21‚—‘ venditum ·atque emancipatum
tribunatum?

ib. aninae, i. e. Cleopatra.

16. Ωωιοχήιιπι, “ a gnat οι· mosquito net.” κιιιινιιίιι-ειον,ι fr. κώνωψ, “a gnat.'' - Cp.
Propert. 111. ιιι. 45‚—‘ Foedaque Tarpeio conopia tendere saxo.’

17. At hoc frementes. The readings of the MSS. are very various,—ad huc, ad hunc,
at hac ‚- the last having most authority. Ad hoc, ‘⁸ hereupon’· (vu-plu* ταῦτα), is
one of the simplest corrections. At hoc is preferred by Orelli; and he takes
hoc as the acc. aster frementeS, quoting Tacit. Ann. 1111. 13. The sense will
be—“ Crying out indignantly upon this, indignant at it ” Cp. Virq. AEn. ιιι.
132,-‘ Unoque omnes eadem ore fremebant3' and Livy, ιιι. 8‚-‘ Cum pro

ingenio quisque fremerent,' aud 11. 5, — ‘Haec frementibus hora fatalis
ignominiae advenit?

18. Galli, ι’. e. the Galatian troops of Deiotarus and Amyntas, who went over from
Antony to Octavian. (See Plutarch’s Isise os Antony.)

ib. Canentes. Compare Virq. AEn. v11.698,—‘ Ibant aeqnati numero regemque
canebant? (Where see Forbiwr. )

20. Pappes sinistrorsum citae‚‘ ‘backed towards the left,’' i. e. eastward. Puppem
ciere seemszoepbpwav ἆνιικρούεσθιιι,ι ‘to back waterl'

21. Tu moraris. 7· ι. e. “Why do you delay? when shall Caesar celebrate his triumph ?''

22. Intactas. Viry. Georq. ιν. 5110,—‘ Intacta totidem cervice juvencas? Victima
were not to have been used for any meaner pur ose, that were consecrated to

the gods. So Hom. Π. κ. 293,-ῥέξω βοῦν...ἀδμ την. So Odyss. γ. 383. Com-
pare the story in Son-they’s Kehama, C. vm.
