length in Bothe's edition.) He shows that not only in the Venetian dialect,
but in the country langnage os the Campagua, parra has passed into the form ,
parruzza, and signifies ‘⁶ the common or barn owl.’' Pliny mentions the parra
(N. H. xvm. 69) without describing it; and appears ιο use oenanthe (x. 45)
as another name for it, which would probably indicate (see Lidd. and Scott in
v. οἰνάνθη) its downy seathering. 1 find it asserted that parra, in the Linnaean
classiflcation, stands for “ lapwiny ,·'’ this is erroneous : trinae. is “ the lapte-inq?
parra the “ jamna '¹ (a tropical and non-European bird) in many points of habit
and description corresponding to the other, and belonging to the same order,
viz. the Gralloe, or Stilt-birds, but of a distinct family.

6. Similis sagittae, ‘⁴ shooting across like an arrow.’' AEschylus‚ Eum. 181, goes
so far conversely as to use πτηνὸν ὄφιν for ‘⁴ an arrow.” (In S.S. Genes. xmx.

Eeb-r. in the margin is “ arrow-snake.”)

12. Solis ab ortu. This is used not of the time of prayer, but of the position of the
devotee, who would look to the East for a favourable omen. That was the
propitious quarter, observed alike in offering prayer or in expecting angui-ies.
See Vin-9. AEn. xu. 172,—‘ Ad surgentem conversi lumina solem! Hence with
Roman augurs, (who, in consulting the aspect of the hcavens, turned their
faces southward, and consequently had the East on their lest) the signs on
the left hand were lucky. So in γίνῃ. AEn. 11. 693,—-‘ intonuit laevum) Ovicl,

usage ; since, owing perhaps to natural associations of ideas, but mainly, it is
said, to imitation of the Greeks (who in taking omens looked northward, and
so had the East ιο their right,) ἀφυΐαν came to be used in a good sense, (γίνῃ.
