NOTES ΟΝ THE EPODES .· ΟΑΒΜ. ειν, xv. 123

CARM. X1v.-AD MAECENATEM.

1. Imis...sens‡”bm. The same phrase is found in γίνῃ. Ecl. 111. 54.

4. Τναωονίγπ, “ quaffed ;'’ an uncommou signification of traho. Doering quotes
one instance of it from Valer. Flacc. 111. 609. No doubt Horace substituted
the word sor the more usual duxerim, on account of the preceding ducentia.
It is found in a kindred phrase, viz. ‘ auras ore trahit,’ Ου. Met. 11. 230; and cor-
responds to the Gr. ἕλκω, ἑλκύω, as in Ewr. Cycl. 417 ς Ιοπ, 1200.

’7. oum promissum. ‘ De hoc toto libro accipe qui nunc Epodon inscribitur ......
‘ significat magnam fuisse hominum de his Epodis expectationem? Bentl.
See the inference‚ a cumulative argument against part of Bentley's Chronology,
drawn from this verse, in class. Musemn, vol. 11. p. 209.

- 8. Aa umbilicum adducere, i. e. “ to complete.” The umbilici or cornua (Ov. Trist.
Ι. 1. 8) were besses upon the end of the rollers on which the sheet of the
volumen was rolled. Therefore, as evolvere librum is “ to open or begin‚'' ad
mabilibum venire, or ducere, is “ to come or bring to a close.” Mart. lv, xc tv. 2.

11. Cava mudmwm. Cp. Viry. Gom-9. Π. 464.

13. Ureu-is, ,“ you are in love,'’ sc. with Terentia. Cp. the complimentary mention
in 0. 11. ΧΠ. 13, sqq. We have no clear information as to the time of Maecenas’
marriage. Ifthe dates of the various odes could be established, they might
afford a chasma). ΙΙ. 111. implies a recent marriage; this Epode a courtship‚
and a succes one.

ib. Qus-ket& “ But think yourself a fortunate man, since Helen was not more

CARM. XV.—AD NEAERAM.

3. Numen loeswra, πλε. by faithlessness, pet-jury. (Compare the Ode to Barine,
Cam. II. vul.) Cp. Ov. Her. 11. 43. Virq. Ecl. vm. 19,—‘ Divos, quamquam
nil testibus illis Profeoi.'

4. In verba juo-abas. This phrase seems properly used of repeating the military
oath. ‘Citati milites apud trib. mil. in verba P. Scipionis jurarunt.’ Liv.
xxvxn. 29. So, conversely, peraeire verba, “ to prescribe the form of oath,” or
prescipere, as in Liv. I. 59,—-‘ Ut praeceptum erat jurant! Cp. Ov. A. A. 1. 687,
—‘Jurabant omues in laesi verba mariti) Jurare in verba (Epist. I. 1. 14) is
used of adopting a particular teaoher's rules.

5. Artius atque, “ clinging closer than 'the ivy to the oak.’' Cp. shakespearo, Mias-
Myra, Act IV. Sc. 1:
‘ The female ivy so

‘ Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.'

15. Nec semel offen-sce, “ nor will my resolution yield to your chat-me, when once Ι
“have taken offeuce at, or dislike to, them.” Qffensus is used together and
synonymously with invisus by Cicero, pro Sest. 58.

16. Certus...dozor, “ a settled resentment.” Into-amit, so. me .- others have under·
stood te, aud interpreted the line as=si te paenituerit. This would give a less
proper sense to dolor.

17. Tibuzl. 1. v. 69,—-‘ At tu, qui potior nunc es, mea fata timeto!
