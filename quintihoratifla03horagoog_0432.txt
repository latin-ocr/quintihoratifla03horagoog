188 NOTES ΟΝ THE SA'HRES: BOOK 1. SAT. 111.

¹71. Inclinat, “lean to‚” depress the balance in favour of. ‘Mire pro propensior
sit! [G.] The meaning belongs naturally enough to the verb (cp. Cic. de Or.
nav, 187,—‘ Si se dant et...sua sponte, quo impellimus, inclinant atque pro·
pendent‚') the dative following it is, to say the least, very rare. Indi-nare is
used both as a transitive and a neuter verb ε there would be no difficulty here
in understanding an ellipse of animum or se, as in the above quotation of
Cicero. We might even supply lancem, considering how fully the metaphor is
⁴ kept up z in that case, pluribus would be ablative‚—inclinet lancem pluribus:

‘⁸ press down the scale with these as more numerous.”

72. Si volet. . ponetur. The correspondence os tenses is not a grammatica] necessity,
bnt it furnishes some argument at least sor connecting these two verbs as
antithetical. Orelli has a comma after inclinet, and a colon after volet.

ib. Ίέηιτίῖια, thg cavity, in which the tongue (examen) of the balance plays. See
emus, V. .

73. See the New Test. S. Matt. VII.

¹76. Iroe. This is a genitive os apposition. In this usage the leading noun ex·
presses a general idea; the genitive a special one, to denote or detine it. (See
Madv. Gr. ξ 286.) There is a parallel instance in Cis. pro Murem. x. 23,—-‘ Aliis
‘ego te virtutibus, continentiae, gravitatis, justitiae, fidei, ceteris omnibus,
⁸ consulatu et omni honore semper dignissimum judicavi .' This genitive is used
poetically in local or geographical tet-ms, e. 9. urbem Pata vi, Mycen α’, Buthroti, in
AEn. 1. 2471 v. 52; 111. 2933 tellus Ausoniae, ιιι. 477; and in descriptive
terius, as in Liv. xxIV. 3,-‘ LucuS...proceris abietis arboribus septus.’
(Arboremfici‚ in Cic. pro Flacc. 17—41, is probably an interpolation). So in
Suet. Auq. 94, arborem palmoe.

82. Labeone, M. Antistius Labeo, afterwards a distinguished jurist. At this timo
he was very young: he gave offence to Augustum and Walckenaer suggests
that this satiric mention might have been intended to shield him from a

real hostility.
83. Dicatur. The Delphin Ed. points this clause interrogatively.
85. Observe the variation from cui concedere, in S. Ι. Π. 140.

88. Mercedem. See note on Sat. 1. 11. 14. Cp. ‘Debitor usuram (“interest'')
pariter sortemque (⁶⁴ principal”) negabit! Mart. V. XLII.

91. Evandri manibus tritum, i. e. “ a curiosity as old as the time of Evander.” This
must be the Arcadian Evander of AEneicl, VIII. 52. sqq. The Scholiast supposes
the sculptor to be meant, Aulanius Evander (Plin. N. H. XXXVI. v. 32), who
was brought by Antony from Athens to Alexandria, and thence (in 29 Β. cu,
and therefore subsequently to the date of this Book of Satires) to Rome.
Tritum. [G.] quotes Martial, VIII. vl. 9 (upon the passion for antiques),—

‘ Hi duo longaevo censentur Nestore fundi ς
‘ Pollice de Pylio trita columba nite-t?

92. Cp. Lucina, Timon, 54.

96. This was the Stoic doctrine. Cp. Cic. cle Fin. IV. 111. 55,—‘ Recte saeta
‘ omnia nequalia, omnia peccata paria ‚· quae cum magnifice primo dici viderentur
‘ considerata minus probantur : sensus enim majusque et natura rerum atquc ipsa
‘ veritas clamabat quodammodo, non posse adduci ut inter eas res, quas Zeno
‘ exaequaret, nihil interesset.'

ib. QuiS...sere placuit, “ who lay down as a general rule.”

ib, liz-beraut, “ they are in a difficulty5 their maxim fails when applied to actual
ι e.
99, Cp, Viry. Georgv. 11. 340,—
‘ Cum primm lucem pecudes hausere virumque
⁸ Ferrea progenies duris eaput extulit arvis?
