36 “ NOTES ΟΝ THE ODES: BOOK 1. xxxv, xxxvl.

17. Saem. 'Phe zur. ‘serva' is in many of the best MS& bui. I see in the old HL A.
(which has serm, the r introduced above, and the gloss dmm) the cause of
the corruption, and a testimony against it. 'rho cause is the writing e for ae,
(see on 8. Ι. 111. 7 ;) but the synonymous gloss dum attests the true word.
The subsequent insertion of r is a copyist’s mistnke.

18. This has been supposed to be taken from a picture. The symbols aptly re·
present the grasp and strength of Destiny. Cp. Car-m. 111. ΠΝ. 5.

—‘ An sese comitem tam tristibus actis abneyet! ‘⁴ Nor scruplcs to be your
