NOTES ΟΝ THE SATIRES: BOOK 1. ΕΔΤ. vu, vm. 155

35. Reqem. Besides the play of meaning in this word (with which Orelli compares
Cic. ad Att. Ι. xvx. 8), juqulas is (by metaphor) capable of a double sense ; it
is used οἷα repat-tce in Ter. Eun. ΙΙΙ. 1. 27.-
‘ Pulchre mehercle! dictum et sapienter, papae!
‘ Jugularas hominem,’ (Eng. ‘⁸ You settled him.”)

SAT [RE VIII.

This Satire is a speech put into the mouth of Priapus, the scere-crow deity
of gardens. It contains invectives against Canidia (see Epode v. and the
introductory note; aud compare Epocze xvn. 58‚) and implied compliments
to Maecenas, who had reclaimed and converted into gar-dens the Puticuli on
the Esquiline bill. These Puticuzi were saud-pits, which, when their stores
had been used up, were left open, as common receptacles for the corpses ot·
suicides, slaves, and criminals. The contemptuous tone of v. 10 is worth
remarking, as an exemplification of the contrast between the heatheu and
the Christian usages and ideas; and this conti-ast will be heightened by con·
sidering that these very saud-quarries of the Esquiline grew eventually into
the famous ‘ Catacombs‚' which were known for ages, first as the biding-place,
then as the semet-cry, of the Christians of Rome.

 

1. Runcus...ficulnus. ἸἾιθοσν. Epi9r. lv. 2,—-66xwov εὑρήσεις ἂρτιγλυφὲς ξόανον.
(A fig·wood statue of Priapus.)

3. Furwm ennumquafformido. Cp. Vin-9. Geor. lv. 110.

8. Huc... ...pm-tanda, i. e. slaves would lay out on a wretched bier the corpses of
their fellow-slaves, for convcyance hither.

ib. Ejecia...cellis, “ cast out from the dens they lived in.” (Augustis cellis sonnds
at first like Gray's ‘ narrow cell,’ but has nothing really in common with it.)

, 10. Commune. Such sepulture in aute -Christian times was looked on as oon-
temptible. See Maitland on the Catdcombs‚ p. 39, who remarks on this passage.
(There is some mistake in his rendering of it.)

12. Mille pedes, i. e. “a frontage of 1000 feet, with a depth of 3ΟΟ.”

13. Heredes. The letters n. u. Η. N. s. (z‘hoc monumentum heredem non
sequitur ⁹) were commonly engraved on tombs, to deprecate ,any alienation os
the ground to other purposes. The mention, however, of a cippus here,
where there was as much exposure as sepulture of corpses, is merely a joke.

14. salubribus, i. e. made so by Maecenas.

15. Quo=‘i‘n quo.- non repetita praep. in post in aprico: [0.] The sense is,—
“ Now there are sunny walks aud cheerful views, where lately all was glooui
“ and whitening bones.'’

22. Ossa leqant. · Ov. Her. vx. 90,—‘ Certaque de ‚tepidis colligit ossa rog-is.⁹

lv. .

25. Magiore, sc. majore natu, to distinguish her from her younger sister. So
maximus is used absolutely, E. Ι. 11. 1.

28. Cruor...ut inde. This remarkable superstition, of the ghosts gathering round
sacrificial blood, is in Hom. Od. λ. 34, sqq.

30. Cerea. γίνῃ. Ecl. vm. 80.

32. servilibus...peritura modis. Compare Liv.xx1v.14; nunes-2111 servilem
- ‘ modum lacerati.’ (For the Syntax, see atq). Sat. Ι. 111. 10.)
