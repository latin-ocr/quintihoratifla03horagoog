29-36, The sense is,-—-Poetie studies are the charm of my life, and elevate it
sebove the vulger, and if you allow my claim to the name of poet, 1 shall
be at the summit of my hopes.

34. Lesboum. So Ι. xxvi. 115 111. xxx. 13,——-‘AEolium carmen’g referring to Alcaeus
and Sappho, as his great lyric models. Some suppose a reference to Ter·
pander (also of Lesbos), to whom the special invention of the βάρβιτος is
assigned (in a fragment of Pindar‚ Scolia, v. ed. Dies.)

36. Ου. eae Ponto, 11. v. 57 3 and Met. vu. 61,-‘ Quo conjuge felix
‘ Et Dis cara ferar, et vertice sidera tangam!
Cp. Vir-9. AEn. w. 322, and Herod. 111. 30, and Wesseling's note.

CARM. 11.—AD cAEsAREM.

Ad Coesarem (Auyustwm Ο. in an old inscription, the anachronism probably of

a copyist). See Chronol. Table, sc. 27. . -

Orelli fixes the date of this ode for B.c. 293 and the feeling atRome, and the

honours lavished on Octavius in that year, accord with its general tenor,

and the hppes implied in it. See Merivale, Hist. Rome, ch. xxx. p. 401,“and
note, p. 4 Ο.

1. Jafm satis. Great storms, followed by an inundation of the Tiber, are here
represented as a judgment upon the crimes of the age (v. 21.)2 appeal is
then made to Augustus finally, to show himself the restorer of the Empire.

ib. Ninia, (‘OR)ecordemur necesse est in meridionali Italia nivem prodigii instar

2. nubente. ‘ His red right-hand? Milton, P.L. ii. 174. Cp. ΔΙα...φοινικοστερόπαν.
Pina. Ol. ix. 6; and ‘ corusca fulmins molitus dextra! Virga. Georq. Ι. 328.
The combination of lightning, hail, and snow, in one description, occurs in

Homer, Il. κ. 5-7.

3. So Ovid, Am. ΙΙΙ. 111. 35,—‘ Juppiter ipse suos lucos jaculatus et arces? Cp.
Cicero’s verses, de Div. 11. 20 (34.) .

6. Soeculum Pyrr-hcc, the deluge of Deucalion. ' See Ov. Meta‘m. 1. 260.

7. Proteus. Ποσειδάωνος ὑποδμώς. Hom. Odys-s. Π. 386. ‘ Pascit sub gurgite
'phecasl Viry. &em-9. tv, 395.

9. Cp. Ov. Met. 1. 296,—‘ Hic summa piscem deprendit in ulmo?

13. Tiberim ...... undis. These inundatione, though not uncommon, were the objects'
of superstitious regard at Rome. Cicero, describing one, (Ep. ad Quint. 111.
7) plays upon the feeling, and quotes Homer, Il. π. 385-9.

14. Litore Etrusco. It is questioned whether these words mean the shore os tho
Etruscan (i.e. Mediterraneun) sea, or, the Etmscan (ie. the right) bank of tha
Tiber. The majority of commentatore adopt the first meaning: Gesner pre.
fers the last. We may conjecture from its use in Cam. δατ. 38, that Eunaeum
litus was sometimes taken popularly to express the berder of Etruria on tho
side of the river, as well as of the sea ε it is in fact a natural association, when
river and sea are united, to include them in ousiam. The rest of the
sentence certainly suggests rather the rebound of a fior-iaus ,βορά from α, jutum
bank in the beml os a river, than the reflua,- os a tide os twenty miles. Retorqueo .
signifies a sudden rapid turn (as comm-quoe, in Viry. AEn. 111. 562). More·
over, if the flood were caused by the meeting of the wetere at the mouth, the
retort would come not ‘⁴ from the coast‚'' litere, but ‘⁴ from the sea,” oequore.
Fnrthermore, if bitere be understood of the right bank, we have the direct
antithesis in v. 18, sinistra ripa, and in the latter word a reason fo'r the adop.
tion of litore in this sense, (author-ised es it is, in reference to the Tiber, by
Vir-qil, AEn. viu. 83) viz. that it avoids tautology. 1 prefer this interpretation,
