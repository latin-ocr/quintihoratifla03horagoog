3. C'oementis, ‘⁴ broken masses, rubble,” from cado· Cp. (both for meaning and
phrase) Carm. ΙΙΙ. 1. 35.

4. Terrenum...publicum. This reading is due to Lachmann. He shows (on Lacr.
1. 360) that the old Bland. MS. reads publicum, with the addition of late patens
as a gloss. (I find it also in ΗΖ. Ε.; and it is a variant in some MSS. for
proximum in υ. 47, a confusion probably arising out of its actual use here.)

Terrenum, a generic technical term for land, (and so used in Liv. 11111. 19,
‘herbidi terreui‚') is a conjectura] correction, necessary, if publicum is read.
Publicus was the legal phrase for things (naturali jure omnium com-munia) free
aud common to all, and “ of no private right ;'' and would, therefore, be fitly
antithetical to occupes, “ you seize or invade aggressively, usurpingly.’'
While there are these positive arguments in favour os Lachmann’s reading,
there are the following objections to the old line: The order of words' ι8 awk-
ward, so is the addition of the adj. omne (we might expect rather Tyrrhenumque).
Fur-ther, though the two adjectives (Tyrrhenum et Apulicum), taken together ιιι
poetic hyperbole, stand for‘ ‘the whole of the coastss’ it is obvious to remark
that Apulia, whether coast or country, was never a favourite resort (‘ in·
anissima pars Italiaess cic. ad Att.v111. 3. Cp.H.E'pod.111. 16, and Sat. 1. v.
78). Nor again· does this name ever occur for the superum mare. Again, the-
form Apulicus is never used, nor is there any instance of the Α being

shortened.

6. Summis verticibus,‘ ‘on the topmost summits. '⁹ The sense is, — “vast as your
“plans and works may be, there is a Destiny above all, from whose over·
“whelming power you cannot be secure. ’ [O. ] says, —- ‘Explica de verticibus,
‘fastigiis, ἀετώμασιν aedium... JAudynn clavos.. in aedium culmine figit domino
‘velut acclamans Hucusque nec ultra! Somewhat analogous is the descrip-

tion of impending retribution in AEschylus, of an avenger whose crushing
weight or force no roof cau resist: Suppz. 647, --

πράκτορι.. ,δν οὔ τις ἃν δόμος ἔχοι ἐπ’

ὀρόφων μιαίνοντα, βαρὺς δ’ ἐφίζει.
Some, however, connect the phrase with the subsequent rather than the
previous context, interpreting it of “ the heights of pride and prosperity '' (as
Jam' interprets‚) or of “ the owner ;'’ as if for vertice in the sense of capite, with the

⁶ plural for the singular, perhaps as being more comprehensive, and also

avoiding any tautology with caput in υ. 8. The first-mentioned way seems the
safest; but if the last were sufficiently approved, the whole sentence, with its
peculia:- metaphor (clavos), aud its indefinite equivocal expression (vm-acibus),
might take its place beside shakespeare‘s allegory (Rich. 11. Act ΙΙΙ. Sc, 11.)
