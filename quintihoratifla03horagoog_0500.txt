50. Adrasum=‘ tonsa cute‚’ Epist. Ι. xvm. 7‚—“ wit-h hair close cut.” Compare
the force of ad, in accido, adm-0, adedo, etc. See No. vn. of Latin Etymloqy
by Claudius, in Journal os Eczucation, 1851. Orelli seems to interpret it as
“ just cut ;'' but (as Obbar objects) gives uo authority.

Ars P. 248 ; and sat. Ι. vl. 29,) or libertus.

56. Proeconem. The Roman proecones were employed at the comitia and all public
assemblies‚ in reoiting proclamatione, edicts, laws3 at public gemes, and the
funerals; also at auctions, So, ‘ voci subjeere praeconis,' oia. de Off. 11. xxul.

ὅ indigna relatu.’ Virq. AEn. lx. 595.

76. Indictis...Latinis. The Latina Ferioe belonged to the class conceptivoe3 they
were annual, but on no fixed day: indicere, or concipere, was the technical

79. Philippus may be compared with Eutrapelus, iu E. Ι. xvux. 31.

is simply,—“ Let every one take his own measure ” (Comp. moduli, sat.. ΙΙ.
111. 309.) Comp. Juv. Χῖ. 34,—· Buccae noscenda est mensura tum?
‘ Metaphora ab iis desumpta qui corporis sui staturam numero pedum
‘ metiuntur! Obbczr‚ apud Orelli. Gesner and others refer the phrase to
“ the shoemaker’s last‚'‘ as the Gr. μὴ ὑπὲρ πόδα τὸ ὑπόδημα, as in Epist. Ι. x.
43, comparing (for the general sense) cic. de Off. 1. 31.

EPISTLE VEL—AD CELSUM ALBINOVANUM.

A letter to Celsus, whom we may conclude, from the hint in the Iasi: line,
to have shown some foolish vanity or elation at being promoted to the post
of secreuit-y, when on Tiberius' staff. The body os the letter consiste of a
sels-repr aching description of the writer’s own deficiencies, his aimless levity

and leth rgy of mind; a description serving to introduce and excuse the
admonition to his friend. ·
