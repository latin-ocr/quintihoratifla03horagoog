NOTES ΟΝ ΤΗΒ SATIRES: BOOK I. SAT. x. 159

and of backiug the established fame of tho old Poet against the growing suc·
cess of the new. Horace defends his expressed judgment‚ unmasks and re-
torts on their jealousy, vindicates contemporary merit, by distinguishing the
great litei-ary names which redeem the age from any slur of inferiority to the
preceding, and with a modest, but confident, assurance appeals to their

de'Plileoffirst eight lines, beginning ‘ Lucili, quam sis ....... ’ are consessedly

spurious.

1. Nempe, a word of acquiesceuce: “ I gyrant, I said, etc.’'

3. sale. It is usually in the plural that this word has the metaphorical meaning
of “ wit and humour.” But Orelli quotes instances of the singular from Cic.
N. D. 11. xxxx. 743 Tusc. Qu. V. mx. 55; Brut. xxxw. 128,—-‘ Omnes sale

facetiisque superabat)
4. Defricuit, lit. ‘⁴ rubbed in,’' as salt into a sore place.

ib. Charta...eadem‚ “in the same satire,’' (the 4th.)

6. Laberi. Decimus Laberius. See Milman's Personoe Hor. Orelli commcnts
thus,-‘ Mimi ipsi non solum Horatio, sed etiarn Ciceroni haud nimis place·
‘ bant? Cic. ad Pam. XII. xv111. 2‚—‘ Equidem sic jam obdurui, ut ludis Caesaris
‘ nostri animo mquissimo ...... audirem Laberii et Publii (Syri) poemata.'
Laberius and his plays gave rise to some jcsts, and perhaps some jealousy ι
see Sueten. J. Caesar, 39. A. Gellius says, L. xvn 14,-—‘ Caesarem ita Laberii
⁴ maledicentia et arrogantia offendebat, ut acceptiores et probatiores sibi esse
‘ Publii quam Laberii mimos praedicaret!

7—15. Eryo non satis est, etc. i.e. “true and finished satire may be humorous,
‘³ must be instructive, free from verbiage, and diversified in style.”

11. Tristi. . . jocoso,

‘ Formed, by thy converse, happily to steer
‘ From grave to gay, from lively to sevore.’

Pope’s Essay cm Man, Ep. IV. ad finem.

12. Modo rhetoris...inter‹lu=m urbani. These seem to be quasi-instances of the
tristi and jocoso ‚- the first, os grave, unsparing declamatory reproach ; the last,
of tempered raillery‚ often (r. 15) in reality the most effective.

13. Urbani, i. e. “the polished wit‚” not coarse, who prefers temper-ed pleasantry
(ridiculum) to savage or crnel jest. For an exposition of urbanus, consult

Trench, Symmyms, p. 147.

14. Ridiculum acri, etc. Orelli well compares Cic. de Or. 11. Lvnr. 236,—
:Qdiosasppe res saepe, quas argumento dilui non facile est, joco risuque
(1ξῖᾞέώῦ says of B. J onson,—

‘ His comio humour kept the world in awe,
‘ And Laughte‘r frightened Folly more than Law.’ ’

17. Hoc stabant, ime. “from this'’ (sc. the finish and freshness of their poet-ry,
dependent on the rules above-described, vv. 7—15) “they derived their
success.’' Stabant. Cp. Epist. 11. 1. 176; Ter. Hecyr. Prot. 11. 75 Phorm.

Prol. 9.

ib. Pulcher, ‘ pulchellus ille et delicatus (stutzerhastcss) [O.] Is the epithet to be
explained from theatrical language Ρ Among the characters brought forward
in the Roman farces (see the account of the Atellanae in Varronianus, ch. ιν.)
*ρηῑοῆεῑῑιμῂ like the Greek Καλλίας, was used to denote apes and puppets.’
From hence is derived our ‘Punch‚' or Polichinello. It is to be observed,

that pulcher here is joined with sirm'us.
