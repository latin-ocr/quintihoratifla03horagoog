NOTES ΟΝ THE EPISTLES.- BOOK ,11. EPIST. 1. 225

7. Colunt, i. e. “improve and civilize.” The growth of civilitation is here
attributed ιο human benefactore, subsequently deified3 ιο barda, inspired
interpretem of the gods, in A. Ρ. 391-400; ιο the introduction of language‚
in Sat. 1. 111. 1033 as by Cicero to Eloquence and to Philosophy (see the

references and quotations there made.)

8. componunt...condunt. These verbs are joined together in E. Ι. 1. 12. This
passage may serve to distinguish them ς the first means chiefly “ ιο combine,
adjust, reconcile ;” the second, “ ιο found and build up.’'

11. Portenta. Luc-ret. v. 87.

13. Urit...proe9ravat‚ “ dazzles and depresses.” This mixture of metaphora has
caused difficulty here, as in Ars P. 441.

ib. Artes infra se, i. e. “inferior excellence.” Cp. Eur. Fr. Bellor. 5,—‹12 τὰπίσημα 1

δ’ ὀ φθόνος πηδᾶν φιλεῖ.

1 l. With the sentiment, comp. Germ. 111. xxw. 313 and Ov. Am. 1. XV. 393 and
Thueyd. Π. Διά-φθόνος γὰρ τοῖς (ὦσι πρὸς τὸ ἀντίπαλον· τὸ δὲ μὴ ἐμποδὼν
ἄνανταγωνίστφ εὐνοίᾳ τετίμηται.

15. ΡἎωῗιηέά,Νειο. Ου. Mt. Π. 10‚—‘ Tu mihi, quod ramum est νίνο, sublime
‘ e 'si omen-⁸

24. Bis quinque viri, “the Decemvirs.”

26. Volumina vatum. Livy, xxv· 12, quotes two specimens of these ancient
prophecies, compooed by the seer Marciae. The extracts are said ιο be in
Saturnian metre, and slightly modernised in form (‘ paulum immutata,' Or.)
The Delphin Ed. ingeniously transmutes them into hexameters.

27. “ That the Latin Muses dictated them ;” i. e. that they have the spirit of true
poetry. Cp⁴ ‘ Musas ipsas Latine loqui credas,’ Ptin. Epis. 11. 18.

31. The sense is,—“ To argue that what is true of the Greeks must be true of the
“ Romane, is as absurd as to say that, if an olive is the hardest inside, so is the
“ nut 3 if the nut has a shell, so has the olive.'’ (Some take it merely as a
proverb, expressing the denial of a manifest truth.)

33. Venimus, etc. So ‘ venit ad summum,’ Cic. Τιιεσ. Qu. 111. (speaking of eloquence.)
Cp. the Greek phrase, ἐπὶ τὸ πλέον ἵκεο, Theocr. 1. 20. The sense is,—-“ We
“ must go on to assert that we have reached the height of perfeetion.’'

33. Unctis. Hurd interprete this to mean ‘⁶ assiduous :’' in its common sense, it
⁸ may simply answer to luctamur.

38. Eecludat ‚im-qia finis. Cp. Pers. Sat. Π. 80,—
‘ Depunge uhi sistam
‘ Inventus, Chrysi ppe, tui finitor acervi!

Here the arguer ‘venit ad soritss' (oie. Acad. 11. 28), ‘lubricum saue et
‘ periculosum locum ' (i. e. the mode of argument called sor'tes, a slippery
treacherous ground for an arguer ιο take.) For (1 b. capi xx x, ‘rerum na-
‘tura nullam nobis dedit cognitionem finium, ut ulla in re statuere possimus
‘ quatenus 3' (i. e. reasonings upon things, in their nature relative, admit of no
determinate standard, as in questions whether a person ‘ dives, pauper, clarus,
obscurus sit; multa, pauea,’ etc.) Therefore, when Horace's opponent cou-
sents to lay down a finis, or fixed absolute standard, ‘cadit ratione acervi,’
(v. 47) his reasoning fans, baffied by the soritic proeess; or, falls to pieoes,
like the heap from which successive grains are withdrawn. (The sorites is
thus defined, coep. xv1,—‘ Cum aliquid minutatim et gradatim additur aut
‘ demitur, soritas hoo vocant.')

45. Gantdoe...equinoe. There is thought ιο be an allusion here ιο the story of
Sertorius m Plutarch's We, ΧΠ.

46. Et item unum. This is Orelli’s reading, aster Bentley: he says, ‘Videtur
sermonis quotidiani esse.’ Etiam umam (a phrase found in Terence, and Pers.
Sat. vt. 58) he supposes to be ‘ ex glossemate corruptela!
