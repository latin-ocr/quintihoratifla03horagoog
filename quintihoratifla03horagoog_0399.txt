10. Genaunes. This tribe is placed by Orelli in the 'I’yrolese Val di Non (N. of
Lago di Garda). They are commonly marked sax-ther west.

11. Brennus, near Brunecken and the‘Breuner Mountain, which probably owes its
· name to them. In the epithet veloces, Donaldson (Van-on. ch. 11. p. 84, note)
discovers a correspondenoe and possible allusion to the name Rae. (See note

<m S. I. v1. 1.) Cp. what Grimm says, as cited by Orelli on Ο. IV. 11. 36, in

reference to the meaning of the name Syqoembn.

Also Viry. Εἰ. vn. 296,-‘ Medias acies mediosque per ignes Invenere viam ς’-
where, however, he observes that there is no metaphor, but an allusion to the
burning of Troy. Here he conjectures enses, but the verses he quotes in sup-
port of it have little in common with this passage, and seem to overlook its
lyric character. The Gr. διὰ τυρὸς ἰέναι is proverbial, for any danger. 1922ae

29. Claudius. The full name was Tiberius Claudius Nero Caesar.

81. Metendo. Cp. the simile, Hom. n. λ. 67,-01 δ’ ὥστ ἀμητῆρες, κ. τ. Nx and (for
the exact word-parallel) Virq. AEn. x. 513,-· Proxima qumque metit gladio!

34. Divae. This is equivalent to auspicia. Originally the Roman commander-in-
chief received them with his imperium, and battles were said to be fought

‘ ejus ductu et auspicio ⁸ (see Liv. ιιι. 1, and xxlv. 8) 3 hence, even in victories
gained by his lieutenants, as the achievement was ascribed to the auspicia,
the honour belonged to him. Under Augustus and his successore, the auspices
belonged to the emperor. Ov. Met. 11. 174,—‘ Auspicium cui (sc. duci) das
grande deosque tuos! Suetonius (Octav. 21), enumerating the conquerod

countries, says,—-‘ Domuit partim auctu, partim auwiciis suis!
